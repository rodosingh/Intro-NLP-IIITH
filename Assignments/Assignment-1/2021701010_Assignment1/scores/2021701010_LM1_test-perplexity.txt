Average Perplexity Score: 16.678
<SOS> however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person <EOS>    PP Score = 5.833
<SOS> it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves <EOS>    PP Score = 10.765
<SOS> madam president mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vice president mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper <EOS>    PP Score = 6.264
<SOS> the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part session <EOS>    PP Score = 13.029
<SOS> i would like mr barón crespo who made the request to speak to propose it that is if he so wishes of course <EOS>    PP Score = 7.114
<SOS> this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament s political and legislative activity for the next five years <EOS>    PP Score = 5.518
<SOS> madam president i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission s legislative programme <EOS>    PP Score = 7.628
<SOS> parliament rejected the request president <EOS>    PP Score = 42.431
<SOS> thank you very much <EOS>    PP Score = 5.010
<SOS> thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by adopting it we contribute to the member states bearing a high level of individual responsibility <EOS>    PP Score = 8.961
<SOS> i should like to address one final point we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much more to be done <EOS>    PP Score = 10.198
<SOS> these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems <EOS>    PP Score = 2.548
<SOS> i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully <EOS>    PP Score = 11.420
<SOS> a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below 20ºc this is in the special interest of northern european regions <EOS>    PP Score = 6.284
<SOS> mr president i would like to thank not only mr koch but also the vice president of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority <EOS>    PP Score = 11.292
<SOS> we are badly behind now in this matter <EOS>    PP Score = 7.679
<SOS> it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes <EOS>    PP Score = 6.727
<SOS> this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent <EOS>    PP Score = 16.158
<SOS> this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again <EOS>    PP Score = 14.913
<SOS> the time has come to implement the programmes and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly <EOS>    PP Score = 13.179
<SOS> mr president mrs schroedter s report undoubtedly contains several important observations and i would like to congratulate her on that <EOS>    PP Score = 9.960
<SOS> quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it <EOS>    PP Score = 6.581
<SOS> if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities <EOS>    PP Score = 17.419
<SOS> mr president i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union <EOS>    PP Score = 12.598
<SOS> we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work <EOS>    PP Score = 4.458
<SOS> at this stage i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective <NUM> rural areas in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective <NUM> regions <EOS>    PP Score = 19.780
<SOS> some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased <EOS>    PP Score = 12.978
<SOS> this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced <EOS>    PP Score = 34.905
<SOS> it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective <NUM> regions that is to say job creation measures special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business <EOS>    PP Score = 6.577
<SOS> most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there <EOS>    PP Score = 22.476
<SOS> we must give them this opportunity <EOS>    PP Score = 20.457
<SOS> the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship <EOS>    PP Score = 8.688
<SOS> secondly partnership a subject which a number of you stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action groups <EOS>    PP Score = 13.909
<SOS> regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly <EOS>    PP Score = 8.357
<SOS> tomorrow the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon i hope it will be italy s turn <EOS>    PP Score = 12.362
<SOS> when there are major set piece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance <EOS>    PP Score = 8.217
<SOS> the minutes were approved <EOS>    PP Score = 8.527
<SOS> we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law that is mr von wogau s report and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe <EOS>    PP Score = 10.277
<SOS> the commission is the executive and parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role for the sake of its own independence but parliament is a supervisory body and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one s decisions than a democratically elected parliament indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion <EOS>    PP Score = 7.762
<SOS> competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions <EOS>    PP Score = 19.263
<SOS> indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition <EOS>    PP Score = 17.194
<SOS> this being the case there are considerable disparities between states which may be measured in various ways such as for example as a percentage of added value and per wage earner <EOS>    PP Score = 6.117
<SOS> it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect <EOS>    PP Score = 16.073
<SOS> under article 88 the commission is obliged to supervise state aid <EOS>    PP Score = 29.194
<SOS> this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years <EOS>    PP Score = 10.706
<SOS> the eu s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed <EOS>    PP Score = 18.882
<SOS> there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate <EOS>    PP Score = 19.161
<SOS> i have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector but i would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters <EOS>    PP Score = 21.669
<SOS> president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism <EOS>    PP Score = 9.397
<SOS> we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private sector monopolies <EOS>    PP Score = 12.328
<SOS> the competition policy has as far as these resources permitted contributed to this event <EOS>    PP Score = 33.595
<SOS> in general i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market <EOS>    PP Score = 20.498
<SOS> it is true there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way <EOS>    PP Score = 7.521
<SOS> fifthly with the pending enlargement i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game <EOS>    PP Score = 8.025
<SOS> the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals <EOS>    PP Score = 15.226
<SOS> i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations lay down clear rules which will benefit all of us businesspeople investors workers and the citizens in general <EOS>    PP Score = 9.059
<SOS> i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area <EOS>    PP Score = 30.037
<SOS> this is unacceptable in my view <EOS>    PP Score = 16.324
<SOS> in accordance with the principle of competition the legislation has implemented articles <NUM> to 94 competition policy in the strict sense and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition <EOS>    PP Score = 3.553
<SOS> in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions <EOS>    PP Score = 6.282
<SOS> the principle of competition must now be universal in its application <EOS>    PP Score = 13.035
<SOS> in my opinion we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed small and medium sized businesses which bind the european economy together and social protection which europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy <EOS>    PP Score = 5.946
<SOS> this is not in question <EOS>    PP Score = 28.470
<SOS> i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission but on the contrary fundamental contributions since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome <EOS>    PP Score = 5.703
<SOS> the proposed system will improve the protection of competition primarily because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals <EOS>    PP Score = 12.149
<SOS> with regard to your suggestions mr jonckheer you already know that my staff who although short handed as usual are fortunately highly qualified are working hard to produce the register of state aids and the state aids scoreboard <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 12.068
<SOS> for some time now these abuses have meant that parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the european taxpayer s money which when all is said and done is what sustains the union s budget <EOS>    PP Score = 9.348
<SOS> this state of deadlock which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union has inspired parliament to initiate the setting up of a european public prosecutor s office <EOS>    PP Score = 11.140
<SOS> the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts <EOS>    PP Score = 38.329
<SOS> the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio <EOS>    PP Score = 16.329
<SOS> the establishment of a european public prosecutor s office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the union is doubtless a good idea but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a european legal system <EOS>    PP Score = 8.477
<SOS> in this way a small european reform may hide a medium sized one and a medium sized one may hide a large one <EOS>    PP Score = 3.939
<SOS> not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a european criminal law and then why not a european minister of justice supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 6.108
<SOS> firstly the classic eurofederalist ideological shift a single market a single vat a single diplomatic service a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor <EOS>    PP Score = 3.537
<SOS> we need a public debate on this <EOS>    PP Score = 15.351
<SOS> we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee <EOS>    PP Score = 9.625
<SOS> we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently <EOS>    PP Score = 6.552
<SOS> the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions <EOS>    PP Score = 17.706
<SOS> as such i would ask you to give olaf s work your full support also in its present form <EOS>    PP Score = 6.169
<SOS> parliament adopted the resolution <EOS>    PP Score = 6.357
<SOS> this is a long way from offshoots such as the community criminal code the european public prosecutor or a european police force with olaf <EOS>    PP Score = 9.426
<SOS> fr it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods <EOS>    PP Score = 5.287
<SOS> this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport <EOS>    PP Score = 13.594
<SOS> i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision making process for the spending of european structural funds <EOS>    PP Score = 12.109
<SOS> the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long term and sustainable jobs in small and medium sized enterprises in rural areas <EOS>    PP Score = 5.749
<SOS> these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent <EOS>    PP Score = 21.978
<SOS>  <EOS>    PP Score = 439.300
<SOS> if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans then we must have a level playing field <EOS>    PP Score = 4.870
<SOS> a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the esf and employment strategy the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the <MOB> programme period implies that the member states really do need guidelines <EOS>    PP Score = 8.733
<SOS> this is repulsive most of all in social terms <EOS>    PP Score = 5.397
<SOS> i am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the eu and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report and also that the directorate general for competition will be making information both general and specific publicly accessible via its website <EOS>    PP Score = 10.068
<SOS> admittedly an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union <EOS>    PP Score = 29.642
<SOS> clearly though it must be monitored a task which falls to the european commission <EOS>    PP Score = 23.919
<SOS> this aid is considerably less than the previous period <MOB> a 13 drop in the total amount and a drop from 3 8 to 2 6 in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector <EOS>    PP Score = 14.266
<SOS> this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder <EOS>    PP Score = 24.616
<SOS> establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable even though article 4 c of the ecsc treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry <EOS>    PP Score = 11.787
<SOS> what are the conditions for this recognition <EOS>    PP Score = 18.652
<SOS> inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up <EOS>    PP Score = 5.196
<SOS> if the charterer s liability entails a financial commitment then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent <EOS>    PP Score = 3.666
<SOS> firstly i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team <EOS>    PP Score = 3.625
<SOS> my group is sympathy goes out to the people of brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster just as my group is sympathy went out to the people of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions <EOS>    PP Score = 9.644
<SOS> the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully <EOS>    PP Score = 5.264
<SOS> finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused <EOS>    PP Score = 18.104
<SOS> admittedly there is the international oil pollution compensation fund iopcf but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level which must be reviewed <EOS>    PP Score = 8.800
<SOS> a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years but it is making very slow progress <EOS>    PP Score = 18.777
<SOS> if the european community had done the same a great disaster would have been avoided <EOS>    PP Score = 17.165
<SOS> let us ensure mr president commissioner that this time we really do learn the lesson even after the media hype and the shock of this house have died down <EOS>    PP Score = 9.599
<SOS> first of all we must shed some light on this shipwreck <EOS>    PP Score = 17.723
<SOS> i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group <EOS>    PP Score = 20.304
<SOS> mr president in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning <EOS>    PP Score = 4.261
<SOS> no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the european union again all those involved including the transport agent are responsible for any ensuing damage and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances <EOS>    PP Score = 5.610
<SOS> we have achieved nothing so far and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 35.219
<SOS> the crux of the problem is that all governments and indeed all the european institutions acknowledge the right of major corporations such as total fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment <EOS>    PP Score = 7.167
<SOS> they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions <EOS>    PP Score = 4.617
<SOS> in our society there is no such thing as zero risk but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety <EOS>    PP Score = 16.272
<SOS> lastly mr president i would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities who reminded me of old times when as the then mayoress i lived through similar situations <EOS>    PP Score = 4.519
<SOS> i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard <EOS>    PP Score = 13.102
<SOS> i have also noted to my great satisfaction that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty or the eurosceptic groups are calling for europe to regulate and i think that this is in fact the right level to take action <EOS>    PP Score = 7.726
<SOS> would sanctions not be appropriate as the commissioner stated for the classification society <EOS>    PP Score = 7.621
<SOS> malta is entering the accession negotiations <EOS>    PP Score = 37.294
<SOS> tv pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks have brought back memories of similar british disasters such as the torrey canyon in 1967 and have prompted many british volunteers to help <EOS>    PP Score = 4.118
<SOS> moreover although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations <EOS>    PP Score = 9.085
<SOS> i sincerely hope that particularly during the french presidency later this year the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 8.718
<SOS> they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through <EOS>    PP Score = 8.126
<SOS> unfortunately the 25 often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily <EOS>    PP Score = 18.870
<SOS> mr president commissioner europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium <EOS>    PP Score = 3.628
<SOS> i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this <EOS>    PP Score = 4.747
<SOS> when in 1994 over five years ago that is i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier <EOS>    PP Score = 11.644
<SOS> secondly i was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner s proposal to create a european civil protection body <EOS>    PP Score = 30.900
<SOS> the same when the floods came in france and the same again now <EOS>    PP Score = 16.123
<SOS> mr president i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission is white paper on food safety adopted on wednesday last <NUM> january in association with my colleague mr liikanen <EOS>    PP Score = 8.419
<SOS> there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority <EOS>    PP Score = 12.708
<SOS> i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available <EOS>    PP Score = 4.560
<SOS> parliament played a crucial role in europe is response to the bse crisis <EOS>    PP Score = 22.687
<SOS> it has especially active since then in bringing citizens concerns about food safety issues to the fore <EOS>    PP Score = 6.514
<SOS> i hope that we can thrash this out <EOS>    PP Score = 3.575
<SOS> once that is done issues such as liability can be addressed <EOS>    PP Score = 7.640
<SOS> it must be visible <EOS>    PP Score = 23.508
<SOS> it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous <EOS>    PP Score = 22.922
<SOS> quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for or advising the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level <EOS>    PP Score = 4.867
<SOS> that is my judgement at the moment <EOS>    PP Score = 14.065
<SOS> on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had <NUM> minutes of response by the commissioner and his statement <EOS>    PP Score = 14.776
<SOS> that concludes the debate <EOS>    PP Score = 9.947
<SOS> none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment <EOS>    PP Score = 8.798
<SOS> no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf fact finding mission <EOS>    PP Score = 3.626
<SOS> that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do <EOS>    PP Score = 4.293
<SOS> i cannot answer that question <EOS>    PP Score = 21.786
<SOS> i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue <EOS>    PP Score = 7.446
<SOS> according to the rules of procedure you are not required to reply <EOS>    PP Score = 14.218
<SOS> the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development part of the so called induction courses for new staff something that has been done already but not i admit on a regular basis <EOS>    PP Score = 4.731
<SOS> as far as possible we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset instead of having to be tackled separately and later <EOS>    PP Score = 11.559
<SOS> it is not to be brought in as a sort of optional add on <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 16.425
<SOS> my question is this is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate general for development <EOS>    PP Score = 5.925
<SOS> these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent tajikistan <EOS>    PP Score = 22.763
<SOS> but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia <EOS>    PP Score = 39.323
<SOS> i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well <EOS>    PP Score = 25.984
<SOS> in other words do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece <EOS>    PP Score = 6.669
<SOS> of course it is as you say <EOS>    PP Score = 17.402
<SOS> what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states programmes <EOS>    PP Score = 9.077
<SOS> secondly there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented <EOS>    PP Score = 10.112
<SOS> where i cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which as you know is not included in the articles of the treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the treaty <EOS>    PP Score = 9.330
<SOS> however for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance freedom of movement is still highly restricted <EOS>    PP Score = 8.548
<SOS> i am grateful for the fact that the commission has adopted an action plan <EOS>    PP Score = 11.317
<SOS> it has not yet been passed by the council it is at the consultation stage <EOS>    PP Score = 24.132
<SOS> this is in place too <EOS>    PP Score = 114.949
<SOS> this is not only necessary for proper public administration it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen <EOS>    PP Score = 7.733
<SOS> but we need that reform process <EOS>    PP Score = 52.301
<SOS> we have to remedy that <EOS>    PP Score = 39.953
<SOS> the other issue is access to confidential documents <EOS>    PP Score = 6.562
<SOS> i would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks <EOS>    PP Score = 7.823
<SOS> it is about a commission which is no more <EOS>    PP Score = 49.237
<SOS> take for example the pledges made by the commission they look good in themselves <EOS>    PP Score = 28.478
<SOS> i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them <EOS>    PP Score = 11.293
<SOS> the debate is closed <EOS>    PP Score = 4.752
<SOS> parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules administrative procedures and management practices <EOS>    PP Score = 5.104
<SOS> too many young new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years <EOS>    PP Score = 4.294
<SOS> merit must be recognised and rewarded specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade <EOS>    PP Score = 14.393
<SOS> in june of last year europe is voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism <EOS>    PP Score = 4.612
<SOS> i am opposed to european community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat whistle blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium <EOS>    PP Score = 4.350
<SOS> have the lessons not been learnt <EOS>    PP Score = 25.048
<SOS> can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse <EOS>    PP Score = 12.045
<SOS> finally can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public <EOS>    PP Score = 21.035
<SOS> i think that the report drawn up by the wise men has been useful and i think that it is also useful for this parliament as already stated by mrs morgan that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run <EOS>    PP Score = 6.521
<SOS> it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late <EOS>    PP Score = 9.732
<SOS> i therefore understand why we are meeting at this time which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates discussions and the exchange of information <EOS>    PP Score = 8.202
<SOS> the commission is sending out the wrong signals here by renaming the directorate general for financial control as the directorate general for audits for example <EOS>    PP Score = 6.459
<SOS> this must be regulated during the igc <EOS>    PP Score = 59.856
<SOS> therefore independence is prerequisite for effective checks <EOS>    PP Score = 10.694
<SOS> there are too many rights too many regulations and too little room for leadership <EOS>    PP Score = 10.412
<SOS> this report is about the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 66.805
<SOS> we should get it into perspective <EOS>    PP Score = 26.138
<SOS> it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation <EOS>    PP Score = 34.486
<SOS> i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement also with its amendments <EOS>    PP Score = 8.277
<SOS> finally the issue of officials <EOS>    PP Score = 113.127
<SOS> this report seems to me to be redundant long winded confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used <EOS>    PP Score = 8.758
<SOS> turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations <EOS>    PP Score = 37.344
<SOS> as the house knows and has repeatedly said the scale and scope of the union is financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures <EOS>    PP Score = 4.271
<SOS> essentially and with legal change the commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the financial controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that directors general are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the european union budget <EOS>    PP Score = 6.690
<SOS> turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud corruption mismanagement and nepotism the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong doing <EOS>    PP Score = 8.316
<SOS> as i made clear in the hearings last september and on other occasions we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed <EOS>    PP Score = 29.235
<SOS> standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house <EOS>    PP Score = 22.326
<SOS> it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities <EOS>    PP Score = 15.729
<SOS> a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months <EOS>    PP Score = 23.819
<SOS> the debate is closed <EOS>    PP Score = 4.752
<SOS> but let me remind honourable members that the european union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process <EOS>    PP Score = 14.232
<SOS> i would therefore like equally firmly to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences which are still no doubt profound between the parties <EOS>    PP Score = 8.604
<SOS> in my judgement this constitutes a guarantee to both sides both from a political and a financial point of view of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for <EOS>    PP Score = 15.335
<SOS> the low level of releases of palestinian prisoners and the fact that the israeli government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted as well as not approving new ones pose further obstacles <EOS>    PP Score = 9.809
<SOS> the time has come for israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories at last recognising once and for all the authority of palestine whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of yasser arafat <EOS>    PP Score = 6.416
<SOS> the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment <EOS>    PP Score = 13.475
<SOS> dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july 200 the date promised by ehud barak <EOS>    PP Score = 5.351
<SOS> schengen has been incorporated as we said earlier into the acquis but it has been done with very little transparency <EOS>    PP Score = 6.328
<SOS> turning to the specific questions that mrs terrón i cusí has put to us i shall group them into three basic areas the fight against organised crime the operation of the judicial network particularly as regards criminal matters and questions on europol <EOS>    PP Score = 6.483
<SOS> another area is eu involvement in the united nations convention against transnational organised crime and its various protocols and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the council of europe in particular on cyber crime <EOS>    PP Score = 12.878
<SOS> for this reason it is essential that the council s debates on the future of europol and eurojust should be conducted in parallel so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also <EOS>    PP Score = 11.661
<SOS> we are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime <EOS>    PP Score = 29.408
<SOS> what direction do you intend to give to article <NUM> of the ec treaty <EOS>    PP Score = 11.407
<SOS> you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning fort europa schengen eurodac etc any democrat can spot two key problems <EOS>    PP Score = 8.339
<SOS> but secondly the projects will put a strain on indeed will be injurious to the national democracies <EOS>    PP Score = 4.732
<SOS> mr president today the people of northern ireland see a strange irony <EOS>    PP Score = 14.087
<SOS> charges brought against loyalists in <NUM> totalled 193 while those against republicans totalled <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 2.706
<SOS> the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country spain and in belgium are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy <EOS>    PP Score = 19.956
<SOS> mr president i would like to welcome the president in office and his colleague from the justice ministry mr costa and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed <EOS>    PP Score = 4.442
<SOS> we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements <EOS>    PP Score = 26.968
<SOS> we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument together with an implementation committee which would be attached to the commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be <EOS>    PP Score = 15.705
<SOS> how do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the community reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of europe <EOS>    PP Score = 12.051
<SOS> we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense <EOS>    PP Score = 21.838
<SOS> their efficiency has been truly remarkable <EOS>    PP Score = 90.521
<SOS> this is of course a highly sensitive issue <EOS>    PP Score = 16.583
<SOS> i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately <EOS>    PP Score = 19.977
<SOS> mr sjöstedt the answer that i gave was the only answer possible <EOS>    PP Score = 15.251
<SOS> at the moment there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this article and unless there is such a proposal we cannot move forward on this matter <EOS>    PP Score = 9.354
<SOS> i am up to a point concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision making process <EOS>    PP Score = 12.252
<SOS> i believe that the commission s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function but i think that there is always room for improvement in this matter <EOS>    PP Score = 18.634
<SOS> question no <NUM> by h 0785 99 <EOS>    PP Score = 2.549
<SOS> it has been shown as we have been claiming since 1995 that this move is appalling and if portugal and france wish to reach an agreement that is fine by us but these anchovies should be fished in portuguese fishing grounds and not in the bay of biscay <EOS>    PP Score = 6.344
<SOS> accordingly mr ortuondo larrea the council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer greater account would be taken of france s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay <EOS>    PP Score = 8.325
<SOS> i would like to point out that in may <NUM> we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth community reference framework for sustainable rural development <EOS>    PP Score = 4.972
<SOS> i thank the president in office for his reply <EOS>    PP Score = 12.270
<SOS> what i asked and what i am once again asking is the following what are the views of the portuguese presidency on for example the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion the division of work and social security the implementation of tax policies particularly for speculative capital and the policy of redistributing wealth <EOS>    PP Score = 12.004
<SOS> i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters <EOS>    PP Score = 24.834
<SOS> you must understand that a presidency s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited <EOS>    PP Score = 7.307
<SOS> since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset it should in my view demonstrate this in practice <EOS>    PP Score = 12.824
<SOS> it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this <EOS>    PP Score = 20.754
<SOS> madam president mr president in office of the council commissioner during the asian crisis in 1997 as with those which hit mexico in <NUM> or the ems in 1993 everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation particularly currency speculation <EOS>    PP Score = 2.758
<SOS> the council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as professor tobin suggested <EOS>    PP Score = 9.553
<SOS> but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability as the commissioner has just so impressively told us is the result of speculation <EOS>    PP Score = 9.568
<SOS> we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short term transactions really is <EOS>    PP Score = 6.406
<SOS> no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information <EOS>    PP Score = 13.795
<SOS> yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies both individuals and states this reaction was more organised than previously due in france particularly to the magnificent attac network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular <EOS>    PP Score = 2.833
<SOS> with regard to the tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation <EOS>    PP Score = 6.865
<SOS> although it seems a reasonable scheme the tobin tax is not without its problems even if there should be agreement as to its implementation which i do not believe there will <EOS>    PP Score = 9.003
<SOS> madam president i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders <EOS>    PP Score = 13.768
<SOS> i am disappointed in the epp <EOS>    PP Score = 25.366
<SOS> over optimism will give way to disappointment and fear which in turn will result in a stock market and economic crisis <EOS>    PP Score = 5.421
<SOS> the danger is too great for us to ignore <EOS>    PP Score = 13.494
<SOS> he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all <EOS>    PP Score = 8.475
<SOS> and it is precisely the medium sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result <EOS>    PP Score = 10.503
<SOS> that too is feasible <EOS>    PP Score = 162.458
<SOS> adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting <EOS>    PP Score = 5.223
<SOS> well patently if we do open this debate today madam president as you are requesting and as the conference of presidents is requesting on the basis of rule 50 we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments enabling some other majority in this parliament at some future time to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free regular peaceful and democratic elections within a member state <EOS>    PP Score = 8.625
<SOS> this is an appeal to the majority of austrians who have not voted for haider who have voted for the clearly democratic options committed to europe and i must point out that mr schüssel may have been minister for finance but chancellor vranitzky also contributed to austria s integration process <EOS>    PP Score = 8.426
<SOS> we are astonished by the political naivety of people who with thoughtless words have bolstered mr haider s position in austria and made the union look ridiculous riding roughshod over article <NUM> of the treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures <EOS>    PP Score = 6.477
<SOS> your parliament may i suggest madame president should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country <EOS>    PP Score = 6.605
<SOS> austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it rightly or wrongly <EOS>    PP Score = 4.283
<SOS> your behaviour stems from your own prejudices you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose <EOS>    PP Score = 6.869
<SOS> however by the same token there is another austria the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the fpö having any involvement in government and who will continue to demonstrate against this government <EOS>    PP Score = 6.673
<SOS> our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational neo nazi element in europe is extraordinary <EOS>    PP Score = 3.896
<SOS> we are talking about us not austria <EOS>    PP Score = 9.896
<SOS> i would however like to draw your attention to the fact that the president in office who has been so critical of austria has recently consigned the inhabitants of macao to the sovereign rule of the people s democratic republic of china <EOS>    PP Score = 7.955
<SOS> madam president i am pleased about the fact that in austria the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes in my eyes a huge victory for democracy <EOS>    PP Score = 8.353
<SOS> i feel that today s meeting is not a meeting of europe our institutions with austria or mr haider s party <EOS>    PP Score = 10.106
<SOS> it would be politically astute not to isolate the övp but to support it as an undeniably democratic constitutional and well known european party so as to be equally certain that austria will continue to be a member of this european community and that is why we must give the övp our support in this difficult situation and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take <EOS>    PP Score = 10.543
<SOS> there are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with herr haider s offensive statements the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies sometimes on successive days <EOS>    PP Score = 4.800
<SOS> thank you commissioner kinnock <EOS>    PP Score = 13.953
<SOS> of course this is shared by the whole commission <EOS>    PP Score = 24.122
<SOS> mr president commissioner regarding the relationship between science on the one hand and applying the precautionary principle on the other the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence <EOS>    PP Score = 6.205
<SOS> the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists <EOS>    PP Score = 11.745
<SOS> it ought not therefore to be immediately interpreted as a ban <EOS>    PP Score = 10.210
<SOS> the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle <EOS>    PP Score = 25.882
<SOS> at that time she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof <EOS>    PP Score = 12.437
<SOS> in other words a product s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous <EOS>    PP Score = 14.311
<SOS> obviously i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case <EOS>    PP Score = 16.289
<SOS> granted this the new intergovernmental conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which properly addressed would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the european union s institutions <EOS>    PP Score = 7.063
<SOS> the same applies to the commission and i would again like to thank commissioner barnier for his collaboration with the european parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us <EOS>    PP Score = 15.144
<SOS> mr president the group of the european people s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki <EOS>    PP Score = 8.571
<SOS> it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with <NUM> countries while contemplating a minimal reform <EOS>    PP Score = 9.334
<SOS> having said this mr president this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference <EOS>    PP Score = 19.029
<SOS> the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term because they are very important subjects in themselves <EOS>    PP Score = 35.512
<SOS> in those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda <EOS>    PP Score = 5.196
<SOS> one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court <EOS>    PP Score = 28.757
<SOS> another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention <EOS>    PP Score = 43.654
<SOS> my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent <EOS>    PP Score = 10.260
<SOS> mr president the group of the greens european free alliance believes that the european parliament s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the intergovernmental conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the council and in the end makes it rather irrelevant <EOS>    PP Score = 16.566
<SOS> that is why we need transparency <EOS>    PP Score = 23.233
<SOS> together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens and what i expect to come out of the intergovernmental conference is that the relevant cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year <EOS>    PP Score = 23.749
<SOS> the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint but this is a totally superficial concept <EOS>    PP Score = 19.846
<SOS> brussels knows best <EOS>    PP Score = 370.682
<SOS> there is more to be said on that score <EOS>    PP Score = 20.878
<SOS> it is crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat trick that of the power to act democratic legitimacy and transparency <EOS>    PP Score = 14.220
<SOS> furthermore the tripartite relationship of commission council and parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy where hitherto the council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures for which the commission alone has responsibility <EOS>    PP Score = 5.712
<SOS> the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter perhaps to extend the mandate <EOS>    PP Score = 18.464
<SOS> what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice <EOS>    PP Score = 13.196
<SOS> i can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this last week in the committee i chair but we eventually decided to back the portuguese presidency and we would like to win this wager <EOS>    PP Score = 13.760
<SOS> this effort was appreciated even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals and moreover mr president in office you also expressed different views <EOS>    PP Score = 4.501
<SOS> mr president only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement <EOS>    PP Score = 6.954
<SOS> paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level <EOS>    PP Score = 4.303
<SOS> they rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles <EOS>    PP Score = 7.353
<SOS> with every single geographical extension to the area covered by the eu we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the committee is contemplating especially in paragraph <NUM> which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth <EOS>    PP Score = 9.670
<SOS> owing to the imminent increase in membership the bodies of the future european union must become more effective <EOS>    PP Score = 68.315
<SOS> the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion <EOS>    PP Score = 23.686
<SOS> as far as we are concerned after producing the opinion expected from the commission according to this same article <NUM> of the treaty we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated <EOS>    PP Score = 9.521
<SOS> i do not like the term leftovers any more than richard corbett does <EOS>    PP Score = 3.288
<SOS> this will not be a matter of chance since let me repeat i feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 12.153
<SOS> not only that a conclusion can be reached but that a successful conclusion can be reached which is not necessarily the same thing <EOS>    PP Score = 15.680
<SOS> the current state of play and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again is that there are in fact judgements from the european court of justice relating to employees i refer in particular to those relating to the rush portuguesa case and that of van der elst <EOS>    PP Score = 10.359
<SOS> all provisions i e issues relating to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence rights should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services <EOS>    PP Score = 9.212
<SOS> turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments one of the essential differences is that in place of a service provision card plus notification for each individual contract system provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract <EOS>    PP Score = 12.159
<SOS> when it comes to self employed persons in addition to the amendments already described we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self employment <EOS>    PP Score = 10.895
<SOS> this would make our rapporteur s life considerably easier in the future <EOS>    PP Score = 6.780
<SOS> there is also a proposed amendment to both of mrs de palacio s reports <EOS>    PP Score = 15.415
<SOS> the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards <EOS>    PP Score = 13.982
<SOS> my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment <EOS>    PP Score = 6.814
<SOS> i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result <EOS>    PP Score = 7.205
<SOS> under the arrangements contained in the treaties the united kingdom retains its border controls <EOS>    PP Score = 33.850
<SOS> the strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the eu service provision card and i am with mr wieland on this are essential for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts <EOS>    PP Score = 13.781
<SOS> mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms namely the free movement of people and services did not apply to them <EOS>    PP Score = 11.643
<SOS> he referred to united kingdom border controls and i would like to say to him that member states and this includes the united kingdom are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders <EOS>    PP Score = 6.658
<SOS> we wish to see its competences extended especially within chapter iv of the treaty of the european community and with regard to chapter vi of the treaty on european union and also a review of certain possible options certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens <EOS>    PP Score = 9.774
<SOS> it is essential for olaf to be monitored by a court <EOS>    PP Score = 13.038
<SOS> the extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding anglo french dispute over british beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the union s disputes resolution procedures <EOS>    PP Score = 7.697
<SOS> the unease is justified <EOS>    PP Score = 36.323
<SOS> thank you commissioner <EOS>    PP Score = 10.585
<SOS> we have been asked for eur <NUM> million <EOS>    PP Score = 18.211
<SOS> we agree that it may be granted and we call on the commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring once the decision has been taken that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible <EOS>    PP Score = 6.296
<SOS> another positive development i would like to remind you of is the fact that the old uck is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country <EOS>    PP Score = 7.761
<SOS> the union has decided to assist with a further eur <NUM> million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of kosovo on the basis of an imf report which estimates that a further eur <NUM> million is needed for that reconstruction <EOS>    PP Score = 10.153
<SOS> i would also like to express my concern which is very considerable at the statement by some ministers at the last ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the portuguese presidency not to alter in any circumstances the financial perspectives agreed in berlin <EOS>    PP Score = 6.324
<SOS> it is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe in the interests of the persons affected <EOS>    PP Score = 11.134
<SOS> accordingly we would like to take this opportunity to urge the commission and council presidency to seize this political initiative so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month rather we must use this initiative to establish a long term aid strategy for this country and i hope that in the process you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months <EOS>    PP Score = 9.983
<SOS> these are events and situations that cannot be tolerated <EOS>    PP Score = 19.289
<SOS> it is irrelevant as far as i am concerned as to whether it is serbs roma bosnians or albanians who are threatened or killed in kosovo <EOS>    PP Score = 11.345
<SOS> i think i have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight s debate <EOS>    PP Score = 6.185
<SOS> in our view however in both respects greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the united nations which on the ground is more aware of the reality than we are <EOS>    PP Score = 11.625
<SOS> some of the amendments in your report pose this question <EOS>    PP Score = 27.790
<SOS> in this way we would have no problem in acting immediately we would not create problems for the kosovar people but on the other hand we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing <EOS>    PP Score = 13.183
<SOS> what i proposed to you and what i still say is that the commission will make a statement in the council decision something like this <EOS>    PP Score = 16.740
<SOS> promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment <EOS>    PP Score = 36.531
<SOS> i can vouch that i have already received significant interest in the altener programme from my own constituency of leinster a significant portion of which falls within ireland s only objective i region <EOS>    PP Score = 14.263
<SOS> here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings <EOS>    PP Score = 14.564
<SOS> it is something that we can all support <EOS>    PP Score = 35.426
<SOS> one seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision <EOS>    PP Score = 5.992
<SOS> not because our delegation our rapporteur and the chairman mr gargani did not work exceptionally well they worked very hard indeed and not because i have any strong objection to commissioner reding s attitude i think that given the framework she was operating in her attitude was particularly positive but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the council <EOS>    PP Score = 4.508
<SOS> alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day culture may not seem that important but it is and we have to be careful in the european parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important <EOS>    PP Score = 12.279
<SOS> the culture <NUM> programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between parliament and the council <EOS>    PP Score = 7.803
<SOS> i know that you as members of parliament in your own regions and countries are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers as one member of parliament said go to make a vast multicoloured carpet <EOS>    PP Score = 11.458
<SOS> this parliament has been given more authority so let us use it <EOS>    PP Score = 51.127
<SOS> let us have the courage to put together a ground breaking directive <EOS>    PP Score = 9.900
<SOS> as from 2006 therefore all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners <EOS>    PP Score = 3.126
<SOS> also it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer <EOS>    PP Score = 13.728
<SOS> mr president we need to take an important decision today <EOS>    PP Score = 14.210
<SOS> according to the group of the greens this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations <EOS>    PP Score = 35.860
<SOS> this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility financial as well as otherwise for recycling vehicles <EOS>    PP Score = 9.810
<SOS> i think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry <EOS>    PP Score = 11.212
<SOS> from an irish perspective i know that the irish department of the environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in ireland in the near future to deal with end of life vehicles <EOS>    PP Score = 13.536
<SOS> we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements parliament is sometimes a little extremist adopting positions that are either extremely pro green or extremely anti green and all things considered find a way to combine the effort made by mr florenz and that of other members who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible <EOS>    PP Score = 5.851
<SOS> in addition car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re use <EOS>    PP Score = 8.818
<SOS> the free recovery system for example for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly <EOS>    PP Score = 7.735
<SOS> it sets in stone one particular model of recycling <EOS>    PP Score = 9.988
<SOS> this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes <EOS>    PP Score = 44.714
<SOS> applause from the pse group <EOS>    PP Score = 6.612
<SOS> these include car manufacturers second hand car dealers the federation of the car industry the metal processing firms shredding firms and the government <EOS>    PP Score = 2.793
<SOS> is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it <EOS>    PP Score = 6.578
<SOS> however we obtained a well balanced common position in july during the finnish presidency <EOS>    PP Score = 12.332
<SOS> i am very concerned about certain amendments from parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question <EOS>    PP Score = 6.641
<SOS> these concern for example the phasing out of heavy metals manufacturer s liability and the requirement for recycling <EOS>    PP Score = 17.395
<SOS> i shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution <EOS>    PP Score = 14.507
<SOS> parliament adopted the resolution <EOS>    PP Score = 6.357
<SOS> the various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various member states <EOS>    PP Score = 3.952
<SOS> i am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the european commission <EOS>    PP Score = 11.910
<SOS> the goal for the years to come is to increase women s participation to achieve a rate of 40 female participation in the marie curie grants in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development <EOS>    PP Score = 6.430
<SOS> we cannot forget old car enthusiasts either of whom there are more than <NUM> <NUM> in finland alone <EOS>    PP Score = 12.975
<SOS> instead it should leave member states to develop their own systems and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good <EOS>    PP Score = 18.581
<SOS> until now the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the union of non community workers have been very harsh <EOS>    PP Score = 28.428
<SOS> the first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a member state which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another member state on a temporary basis to provide services there <EOS>    PP Score = 7.994
<SOS> logically in order to be given such a card the employee must be legally resident in a member states and must be covered by a social security scheme <EOS>    PP Score = 21.944
<SOS> we therefore of course support the european parliament s now giving the formal go ahead to the intergovernmental conference <EOS>    PP Score = 3.020
<SOS> it is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the european parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in austria <EOS>    PP Score = 11.743
<SOS> incidentally the french will probably be interested to learn that the commission is asking for article <NUM> of the amsterdam treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the european parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 10.099
<SOS> an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process <EOS>    PP Score = 6.116
<SOS> in fact one only need look at the agenda of the igc the institutions enlargement and european defence <EOS>    PP Score = 4.462
<SOS> i therefore of course support the european parliament s now giving the formal go ahead to the intergovernmental conference <EOS>    PP Score = 3.013
<SOS> i was in sympathy with the edd group amendment talking about rejecting the interference of the eu in the formation of governments of members states but i had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia racism etc and i felt that it might be misinterpreted <EOS>    PP Score = 9.545
<SOS> if you want to combat xenophobia and racism and i believe that we should we need to look at the root causes <EOS>    PP Score = 15.343
<SOS> i very much welcome the position taken by the italian radicals and i say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between italian liberals and austrian liberals <EOS>    PP Score = 5.572
<SOS> do not count on me to keep quiet without doing or saying anything <EOS>    PP Score = 9.424
<SOS> of course i in no way agree with the publicised statements of this right wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the hitler regime <EOS>    PP Score = 4.780
<SOS> nothing of this nature has yet occurred in austria <EOS>    PP Score = 4.479
<SOS> in the past the british conservatives double standards have brought the united kingdom s house of commons into disrepute and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 8.767
<SOS> there are now <NUM> channels here in this parliament including two greek one portuguese one finnish and one belgian but still no dutch and as many as seven english six german and six french <EOS>    PP Score = 6.835
<SOS> it is not a very time consuming matter but it is extremely important that it should get through parliament now and that there should be no delays <EOS>    PP Score = 12.677
<SOS> it is not an old one it was issued in <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 5.339
<SOS> last thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one and a half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote <EOS>    PP Score = 8.026
<SOS> on friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda <EOS>    PP Score = 6.217
<SOS> i understand that there is no argument about the fact that the council declaration on the next sitting of the united nations commission on human rights is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the geneva conventions and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part session in march so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way <EOS>    PP Score = 10.844
<SOS> upon referral to committee we examined over a hundred amendments and so far <NUM> amendments some of which have already been presented in committee have once again been tabled <EOS>    PP Score = 12.799
<SOS> interreg is one of the four community initiatives scheduled for the period <MOB> and is the one with the largest budget for implementation i e eur <NUM> billion as opposed to eur <NUM> billion at the present time <EOS>    PP Score = 11.833
<SOS> leader ii <MOB> for which a total evaluation has unfortunately not yet been completed had a wider scope than leader i there were probably over <NUM> beneficiaries and the sums allocated after reallocation of resources probably amounted to over eur <NUM> <NUM> million <EOS>    PP Score = 2.389
<SOS> it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 6.350
<SOS> parliament therefore can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put urban back on the agenda and get the commission and council to make a u turn <EOS>    PP Score = 9.848
<SOS> the millennium youth park project is helping to get young people re engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community <EOS>    PP Score = 9.983
<SOS> we are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of <NUM> is not the key factor <EOS>    PP Score = 11.931
<SOS> the commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice <EOS>    PP Score = 10.072
<SOS> the fact that administrative expenditure on interreg ii is in my opinion still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the commission s support programmes <EOS>    PP Score = 9.234
<SOS> that is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure <EOS>    PP Score = 18.147
<SOS> in common with mrs mccarthy i have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced <EOS>    PP Score = 16.965
<SOS> this will cause practical problems in the future and i hope that despite this it will be possible to implement interreg effectively <EOS>    PP Score = 26.659
<SOS> it is important for there to be coordination between leader and the other support initiatives in the european union but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important <EOS>    PP Score = 8.998
<SOS> five months are provided for this <EOS>    PP Score = 19.705
<SOS> because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible <EOS>    PP Score = 5.834
<SOS> assessment and publication are part of this and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past <EOS>    PP Score = 12.473
<SOS> mr president the majority of the borders which have divided europe for centuries were artificially created separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion <EOS>    PP Score = 3.693
<SOS> this is an arduous task <EOS>    PP Score = 59.960
<SOS> as far as the commission is concerned i hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this parliament mainly with a view to reaching a balance <EOS>    PP Score = 17.429
<SOS> i would just like to underline this the situation is of course a little precarious parliament has for the sake of convenience and safety placed the equal programme on the back burner for the time being so that parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed <EOS>    PP Score = 16.120
<SOS> to really guarantee sustainability a buzzword which has since it gained new currency become relatively devoid of meaning but we all know what we mean by it what is needed amongst other things is an integrated approach in the countryside towards for example tourism and agriculture <EOS>    PP Score = 4.052
<SOS> finally in conclusion i would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand c for interregional cooperation even though the added value this offers the community is undeniable <EOS>    PP Score = 25.790
<SOS> of course this is also the basic idea <EOS>    PP Score = 18.920
<SOS> the report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed <EOS>    PP Score = 9.749
<SOS> in addition to the objectives it is working towards the strong point of the community initiative interreg for the <MOB> programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the european union to include new eastern european and mediterranean countries <EOS>    PP Score = 13.347
<SOS> there are fundamental advantages for the whole of europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions <EOS>    PP Score = 20.375
<SOS> i would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed firstly in the case of urban at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various european cities and in the case of interreg at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the european union particularly by including the outermost regions in strands b and c <EOS>    PP Score = 5.274
<SOS> the amount of budget required by our cities where 80 of the european population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in europe i believe clearly indicates that the european dimension should be taken into account and that this urban programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail not to prioritise and therefore not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities by means of european funds <EOS>    PP Score = 7.688
<SOS> leader should supplement already existing programmes avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible <EOS>    PP Score = 8.001
<SOS> none of us wants south american type favelas in europe <EOS>    PP Score = 10.135
<SOS> this makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing <EOS>    PP Score = 21.162
<SOS> our committee on employment and social affairs was after all in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to leonardo <EOS>    PP Score = 5.876
<SOS> on <NUM> october <NUM> the european commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the cap <EOS>    PP Score = 33.574
<SOS> therefore i am putting forward these amendments to parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme <EOS>    PP Score = 15.759
<SOS> thirdly and perhaps this should be the first objective the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families because man is not made for the law but rather law is made for man <EOS>    PP Score = 6.864
<SOS> i also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and i can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to <NUM> january if the programme is presented before <NUM> april <EOS>    PP Score = 7.374
<SOS> an initial joint phare cip committee is to meet in february to assess this coordination and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this together with my colleagues and fellow commissioners verheugen patten and poul nielson <EOS>    PP Score = 19.861
<SOS> according to the general regulations however any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a community initiative must be proposed under article 20 and not article <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 8.018
<SOS> madam president ladies and gentlemen it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the equal initiative in the european parliament just at this time <EOS>    PP Score = 13.249
<SOS> we need specific proposals both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies <EOS>    PP Score = 8.540
<SOS> firstly the enlargement of the thematic areas <EOS>    PP Score = 52.704
<SOS> he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here <EOS>    PP Score = 3.288
<SOS> but it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink as i said a few moments ago it is also economic and political globalisation itself <EOS>    PP Score = 8.721
<SOS> my message to you is do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that i have been less firm in the content <EOS>    PP Score = 9.747
<SOS> a demanding ambitious perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success mr president of the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 5.178
<SOS> president prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation a paradox in the european union and also throughout the world we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium dominated by the web of the internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance and we are living through a genuine change of epoch <EOS>    PP Score = 7.878
<SOS> i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now <EOS>    PP Score = 16.933
<SOS> we understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda which also includes what is known as quality of life priorities that is to say the rights of citizens as consumers and as people in relation to those questions which we always talk about but never give sufficient priority to that is the european social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances consumer rights respect for the environment and sustainable development <EOS>    PP Score = 7.526
<SOS> this is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us i hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next european elections <EOS>    PP Score = 4.667
<SOS> that could convince people that europe in its governance is not something run exclusively from brussels which concentrates and soaks up more powers more decisions more authority <EOS>    PP Score = 4.065
<SOS> we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully <EOS>    PP Score = 8.352
<SOS> do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference <EOS>    PP Score = 14.521
<SOS> we do need to rethink many aspects of current community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success we also need distinctive strategic partnerships with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace <EOS>    PP Score = 12.535
<SOS> the first and most serious criticism concerns the commission s propensity for rather grandiloquent self satisfaction with regard to the european union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners <EOS>    PP Score = 4.348
<SOS>  <EOS>    PP Score = 439.300
<SOS> can we really continue to leave the balkans out of the enlargement process disregarding the fact that croatia macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this house that is open to all <EOS>    PP Score = 25.420
<SOS> like yourself he promised less and better but mr santer finished up by having delivered much more and much worse and i do not believe that you either can deliver the goods you promise <EOS>    PP Score = 2.960
<SOS> we must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across europe confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the internet show that e europe is a good initiative <EOS>    PP Score = 8.737
<SOS> i would also like to say a few words on africa madam president <EOS>    PP Score = 5.668
<SOS> that is transparency <EOS>    PP Score = 118.169
<SOS> applause <EOS>    PP Score = 853.428
<SOS> this is what the commission will be judged on <EOS>    PP Score = 50.309
<SOS> finally you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of austrians or are allowing this to happen just because the result does not suit you <EOS>    PP Score = 3.865
<SOS> i concur with what other members of my political group have said and i commend the tone of your document however there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work <EOS>    PP Score = 11.507
<SOS> however out of all the points two specifically require our attention and they are closely linked peace and stability within europe and outside europe <EOS>    PP Score = 15.882
<SOS> moreover it will only be possible to give the commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded <EOS>    PP Score = 36.971
<SOS> without these prospects that we have outlined europe would once again have no future <EOS>    PP Score = 15.307
<SOS> the union must not make this mistake and i therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this <EOS>    PP Score = 18.258
<SOS> we must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means <EOS>    PP Score = 9.751
<SOS> the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement <EOS>    PP Score = 11.955
<SOS> so with those remarks i would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success <EOS>    PP Score = 10.541
<SOS> i am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture they create jobs <EOS>    PP Score = 31.215
<SOS> truly european citizenship depends on our creating a real visible area of training and culture <EOS>    PP Score = 3.135
<SOS> this house is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating you must therefore listen to our opinions one or two of which i wish to express in my brief speech <EOS>    PP Score = 11.752
<SOS> within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect <EOS>    PP Score = 51.487
<SOS> finally with the emergence the resurgence of the xenophobic right within the european union i hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to article <NUM> by using article <NUM> to combat discrimination and article <NUM> to combat exclusion <EOS>    PP Score = 9.340
<SOS> if we are to ensure that we defeat the fear mongers amongst us those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other both within the present european union and among those who seek to join us and indeed among those in other parts of europe and the world who want to come and live and work in europe <EOS>    PP Score = 9.204
<SOS> finally will you make sure that in the meantime parliament is rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid as they should be on the basis of all the work they do for us <EOS>    PP Score = 17.724
<SOS> if there are such rules who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility <EOS>    PP Score = 7.814
<SOS> as all colleagues will know and many of you have approached me over the last six months all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the comart committee of parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 7.682
<SOS> but all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so called comart committee <EOS>    PP Score = 6.053
<SOS> we shall now proceed to the vote 1 <EOS>    PP Score = 10.886
<SOS> thirdly we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other community programmes as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question <EOS>    PP Score = 13.984
<SOS> this has obliged us to abstain from the final vote because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each member state can dedicate to urban projects that portion of the structural funds which it has not spent in accordance with community programmes <EOS>    PP Score = 12.274
<SOS> at a forthcoming review of these programmes it ought to be established that the eu s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the eu <EOS>    PP Score = 10.679
<SOS> decourrière report a<MOB> 200 <EOS>    PP Score = 30.511
<SOS> these frontiers stretch as far as african states and the middle east we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of europe <EOS>    PP Score = 10.235
<SOS> in cross border cooperation greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium sized undertakings which are the job creators <EOS>    PP Score = 27.624
<SOS> i hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region <EOS>    PP Score = 33.121
<SOS> the european commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions <EOS>    PP Score = 9.632
<SOS> a programme such as interreg is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at european level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale <EOS>    PP Score = 5.904
<SOS> this infatuation with strand iic is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co operation p 17 and that the responsibilities are diffuse and vague p 18 <EOS>    PP Score = 9.399
<SOS> nevertheless new objectives have been included specifically the financing of the nature network 200 for which all rural regions will be eligible <EOS>    PP Score = 11.311
<SOS> although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio economic sectors of the territory concerned government officials must be involved at decision making level whether they come from the municipalities departments regions or national governments <EOS>    PP Score = 6.529
<SOS> i too therefore can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments <EOS>    PP Score = 21.855
<SOS> mr president this proposal to amend the <NUM> directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs <EOS>    PP Score = 26.239
<SOS> yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected belgium and other european countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition <EOS>    PP Score = 6.753
<SOS> he has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this house as well as to the concern of consumers <EOS>    PP Score = 17.501
<SOS> however we must ensure that competition distortions are not created as highlighted by mr kindermann and mrs auroi <EOS>    PP Score = 16.390
<SOS> the treaty of amsterdam states quite clearly that where people s health is concerned article <NUM> is the correct legal base and may i say to our own committee on legal affairs and the internal market that it is simply not good enough to look at the commission s proposal and say there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection <EOS>    PP Score = 12.381
<SOS> we must strike a balance between them <EOS>    PP Score = 39.717
<SOS> one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned <EOS>    PP Score = 16.561
<SOS> this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so i myself share these concerns <EOS>    PP Score = 5.872
<SOS> these are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field food must be of the same standard in all member states <EOS>    PP Score = 16.220
<SOS> the commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations <EOS>    PP Score = 2.945
<SOS> mrs roth behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base whether it should be article <NUM> or article <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 14.122
<SOS> this issue is before parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it which will also come under the legal base of article <NUM> which gives parliament full competence in the areas of codecision <EOS>    PP Score = 13.103
<SOS> the debate is closed <EOS>    PP Score = 4.752
<SOS> many of us here in this house have spent years whether we intended to or not dealing solely with the consequences of the bse scandal right down to the last detail <EOS>    PP Score = 18.063
<SOS> although we did not have a very positive exchange on mr graefe zu baringdorf s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree things may be different with this report <EOS>    PP Score = 10.888
<SOS> we will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even more fundamentally the global balance <EOS>    PP Score = 10.922
<SOS> yet we do not have much time <EOS>    PP Score = 20.424
<SOS> even now the rivers in brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism <EOS>    PP Score = 6.944
<SOS> our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions <EOS>    PP Score = 17.764
<SOS> the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative <EOS>    PP Score = 37.225
<SOS> this brings home the connections which bind us together <EOS>    PP Score = 8.084
<SOS> it is important for us to remember that this is a framework <EOS>    PP Score = 32.753
<SOS> that is the time to debate some of these problems of detail <EOS>    PP Score = 11.239
<SOS> the common position has weakened the stand taken by parliament at first reading <EOS>    PP Score = 15.932
<SOS> it explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the committee on the environment nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading <EOS>    PP Score = 7.392
<SOS> this is unusual but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes <EOS>    PP Score = 16.265
<SOS> i would like to mention two substances from the commission s list mercury and tributyl abbreviated to tbt <EOS>    PP Score = 5.157
<SOS> thirdly we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy <EOS>    PP Score = 11.490
<SOS> mr president every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet yet the abundance of water is an illusion <EOS>    PP Score = 10.917
<SOS> in fact the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects <EOS>    PP Score = 16.619
<SOS> this is enough reason to thank mrs lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water <EOS>    PP Score = 18.330
<SOS> water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples <EOS>    PP Score = 22.339
<SOS> too little operational capacity upstream or in fact excessive use can cause problems downstream <EOS>    PP Score = 3.586
<SOS> mr president commissioner my compliments to mrs lienemann on her excellent work on the water directive <EOS>    PP Score = 17.180
<SOS> moreover an adequate contribution from different economic sectors broken down into industrial household and agricultural sectors must ensure that this policy is implemented <EOS>    PP Score = 2.805
<SOS> europe is therefore facing an arduous task that of combining a community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation <EOS>    PP Score = 3.716
<SOS> the common position is in this respect a farce a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the ospar agreements <EOS>    PP Score = 4.614
<SOS> we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the member states and in conjunction with the european parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 25.444
<SOS> i therefore took a european commissioner and not just the french ones or ambassadors posted in paris or meps to engage in this dialogue each week this made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected listened to and informed <EOS>    PP Score = 5.732
<SOS> this public prosecutor would have the authority recognised by the eu treaty and therefore by the member states to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the community budget and interests <EOS>    PP Score = 7.263
<SOS> commissioner barnier you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of europe <EOS>    PP Score = 8.989
<SOS> this is why i congratulate mr napolitano s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen and the european parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 11.086
<SOS> having said that the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions <EOS>    PP Score = 16.765
<SOS> the european commission has just issued a proposal on transparency <EOS>    PP Score = 32.208
<SOS> i would like to ask him how vigorous the commission will be in this information campaign <EOS>    PP Score = 11.954
<SOS> i do not think so <EOS>    PP Score = 8.188
<SOS> it must get as close as possible to the people where they live and where they have their roots <EOS>    PP Score = 12.342
<SOS> if i said anything different i would be contradicting myself as commissioner for regional policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions you will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people where they live to preserve their roots traditions soul and identity <EOS>    PP Score = 8.221
<SOS> in the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the union and the efforts of its envoy bernard kouchner will the commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of kosovo is right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women women in childbirth and babies <EOS>    PP Score = 15.900
<SOS> the emphasis will be on long term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement <EOS>    PP Score = 6.575
<SOS> so what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under investment <EOS>    PP Score = 14.764
<SOS> let me relate my answer specifically to the question of turkish accession to the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 5.992
<SOS> would the commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a citizens charter <EOS>    PP Score = 23.895
<SOS> therefore will the commission state when they intend to propose under article <NUM> that there is the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 1 and urge the council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this treaty to austria including the voting rights of the representative of austria in the council <EOS>    PP Score = 10.681
<SOS> this principle means that the commission must act within the limits laid down by the treaties and it is in this context that the statement of <NUM> february was made <EOS>    PP Score = 27.463
<SOS> but is commissioner vitorino aware not only of mr haider is and the freedom party is words but also of their deeds <EOS>    PP Score = 16.733
<SOS> i also rely not only on the cooperation of the members of the european parliament but also on the cooperation of non governmental organisations which have always made an important contribution to the anti discrimination policy of the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 21.289
<SOS> some parts of the proposal have been criticised among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste <EOS>    PP Score = 10.955
<SOS> the united states delegation to the european union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste <EOS>    PP Score = 13.037
<SOS> i strongly oppose using the wto and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the eu from introducing radical environmental standards <EOS>    PP Score = 6.556
<SOS> however i totally reject any suggestion that i would allow the united states to determine the shape of our directive <EOS>    PP Score = 15.192
<SOS> i naturally want to know whether the commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes <EOS>    PP Score = 56.495
<SOS> i should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention but there is certainly room for improvement <EOS>    PP Score = 7.693
<SOS> furthermore to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved <EOS>    PP Score = 5.870
<SOS> what is your opinion on that <EOS>    PP Score = 24.157
<SOS> the involvement of regional and local authorities in the community s action is as you know one of the essential elements of the new post berlin structural funds regulation <EOS>    PP Score = 16.582
<SOS> will the commission remain silent <EOS>    PP Score = 35.439
<SOS> then if it is really necessary for me to do this i will make comments or recommendations to the greek government <EOS>    PP Score = 41.035
<SOS> i will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new community support framework <EOS>    PP Score = 22.167
<SOS> this is about 6 of the whole community contribution <EOS>    PP Score = 55.230
<SOS> this is the only answer i can give you on the link between large scale energy transmission networks and the structural funds <EOS>    PP Score = 13.629
<SOS> does section 11 1 conceivably authorise the following practice <EOS>    PP Score = 7.370
<SOS> could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government <EOS>    PP Score = 14.295
<SOS> i am keen that the structural funds particularly those in objective 1 are allocated where needed <EOS>    PP Score = 19.556
<SOS> i believe that this issue is relevant to my question commissioner you were not present at the extraordinarily named official opening of the headquarters of the ohim on <NUM> june in the middle of an election campaign in spain leading up to both the european elections and the local and regional elections <EOS>    PP Score = 9.238
<SOS> also the commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual <EOS>    PP Score = 7.352
<SOS> question no <NUM> by h 0117 00 <EOS>    PP Score = 2.549
<SOS> such a rule is only normal <EOS>    PP Score = 16.725
<SOS> i should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable member since this matter is now under active consideration by the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 11.515
<SOS> in the case of sweden the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol <EOS>    PP Score = 12.829
<SOS> as a result smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one member state than another <EOS>    PP Score = 5.748
<SOS> the sitting was suspended at <NUM> p m and resumed at <NUM> p m <EOS>    PP Score = 1.989
<SOS> we must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which at the same time safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development <EOS>    PP Score = 8.421
<SOS> it sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management <EOS>    PP Score = 18.674
<SOS> its aim of good quality water for drinking for wildlife the environment and economic purposes is right <EOS>    PP Score = 6.551
<SOS> moreover i shall only highlight the most important ones <EOS>    PP Score = 53.788
<SOS> first of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act <EOS>    PP Score = 14.923
<SOS> mr president commissioner we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading <EOS>    PP Score = 20.607
<SOS> we must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly <EOS>    PP Score = 6.107
<SOS> that would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges with each member states drawing up its own scheme so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected <EOS>    PP Score = 6.715
<SOS> the largest volume transferred in one year has been <NUM> and the average volume over twenty years has been over <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 3.270
<SOS> the commission can also in principle approve amendment no 60 according to which a timetable is required for implementing the commission s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances <EOS>    PP Score = 10.611
<SOS> our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue however <EOS>    PP Score = 8.855
<SOS> the common position stipulates a total appropriation of eur <NUM> million for the period <MOB> this is not enough <EOS>    PP Score = 8.994
<SOS> this financial instrument is furthermore deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non governmental organisations <EOS>    PP Score = 3.589
<SOS> secondly the financial contributions <EOS>    PP Score = 32.365
<SOS> commissioner we must be consistent <EOS>    PP Score = 193.496
<SOS> the cost of maintaining the environment which we all enjoy must be met by all of us and the life programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective <EOS>    PP Score = 14.719
<SOS> unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies <EOS>    PP Score = 5.352
<SOS> for five years i have been the representative of the committee on the environment in a regional organisation which assuredly does not have parliament s broad perspective <EOS>    PP Score = 25.930
<SOS> i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention <EOS>    PP Score = 8.432
<SOS> there is also a risk of overlap with other community programmes such as the fifth framework programme for research technical development and demonstration <EOS>    PP Score = 13.393
<SOS> nor can the commission approve amendment no 14 which is contrary to the commission s right of initiative <EOS>    PP Score = 20.613
<SOS> the debate is closed <EOS>    PP Score = 4.752
<SOS> these aspects are very much interconnected <EOS>    PP Score = 92.674
<SOS> the challenges are different <EOS>    PP Score = 138.460
<SOS> needless to say it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at european level <EOS>    PP Score = 17.359
<SOS> finally we urge the european parliament both sides of industry and social ngos to be closely involved in this process <EOS>    PP Score = 18.967
<SOS> we therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved <EOS>    PP Score = 9.888
<SOS> the european union s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy <EOS>    PP Score = 31.630
<SOS> the member states can devise their own systems in the social sphere each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences <EOS>    PP Score = 20.789
<SOS> it is obvious however that these countries impoverished within a communist economic system cannot cope with a social policy like for example sweden s <EOS>    PP Score = 5.738
<SOS> as the uk business grew we invested in more people as the dutch business grew we invested in more machinery <EOS>    PP Score = 2.460
<SOS> this would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this house by showing how remote we are from the real world <EOS>    PP Score = 3.771
<SOS> mr president we are unable to vote for this report <EOS>    PP Score = 30.737
<SOS> i sincerely hope in conclusion that social europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes <EOS>    PP Score = 4.493
<SOS> i would like to make a number of comments about what has been said <EOS>    PP Score = 8.495
<SOS> the next item is the recommendation a<MOB> 200 by mrs cederschiöld on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the proposal for a council decision on the approval on behalf of the european community of the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty <FOOTNOTE> <EOS>    PP Score = 4.653
<SOS> we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands <EOS>    PP Score = 25.890
<SOS> now the union and the member states are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law <EOS>    PP Score = 18.925
<SOS> mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs cederschiöld on her very serious work <EOS>    PP Score = 10.953
<SOS> the problem has been overcome <EOS>    PP Score = 92.680
<SOS> to conclude i want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights <EOS>    PP Score = 4.956
<SOS> in the united states the wipo treaty has already entered into force having been enacted into law by means of the digital millennium corporate act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the treaty by means of this legislation <EOS>    PP Score = 12.471
<SOS> in this context parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the information society which led to the approval of the barzanti report in february <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 7.244
<SOS> mr president i would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today s agenda we decided on monday that the council s statement on the fiftieth anniversary of the geneva convention was to be postponed <EOS>    PP Score = 7.982
<SOS> i shall of course give the commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that i shall be making i would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel at eu level to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years which has benefited people in all walks of life throughout the world in terms of well being and improvements in living conditions with the fact that at the same time there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world <EOS>    PP Score = 8.050
<SOS> the consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets <EOS>    PP Score = 34.646
<SOS> firstly there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players by which i mean donors requiring greater coordination greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems <EOS>    PP Score = 5.161
<SOS> since 1995 following a concerted international effort between the main donor states involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the oecd s development assistance committee it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies both at national and international level <EOS>    PP Score = 7.460
<SOS> firstly we need to make the eu s development policy more effective <EOS>    PP Score = 17.964
<SOS> so without a more active role for the development council in the overall coordination of political decision making which although it directly impacts on the european union s development policy is largely being dealt with outside this decision making forum it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent european union policy on development objectives <EOS>    PP Score = 10.116
<SOS> we base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country is needs but also of its policy performance <EOS>    PP Score = 18.477
<SOS> economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their acp partners <EOS>    PP Score = 23.058
<SOS> such a commitment entails an in depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides <EOS>    PP Score = 13.900
<SOS> turning to our development policy i would say that the global context has changed drastically <EOS>    PP Score = 43.335
<SOS> it is this dual challenge that the commission has to take up by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement <EOS>    PP Score = 17.541
<SOS> we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested <EOS>    PP Score = 35.849
<SOS> the interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government <EOS>    PP Score = 10.670
<SOS> this responsibility cannot only be borne by the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid however much we like to see him or hear him talk or by the development council or the parliamentary committee on development and cooperation <EOS>    PP Score = 12.493
<SOS> we encourage developing countries to respect human rights <EOS>    PP Score = 14.926
<SOS> i will not even mention oil we are all aware of the policy of groups such as elf and total in africa <EOS>    PP Score = 14.172
<SOS> we could also add to the list the next eu oau summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in cairo in april <EOS>    PP Score = 6.331
<SOS> this was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions and this is certainly true of the european union especially in the field of good governance and trade <EOS>    PP Score = 14.586
<SOS> i have in mind budgetary and financing aspects indebtedness assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety humanitarian educational and health related issues and also fields such as the environment investment and access to information and new technologies this also applies to the sphere of trade where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other community policies and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the member states <EOS>    PP Score = 7.052
<SOS> is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of council members rather than a vote reflecting the population in europe which they democratically represent <EOS>    PP Score = 6.398
<SOS> in today s globalised world this fact is all the more obvious <EOS>    PP Score = 10.524
<SOS> at some time or another there will be a revolt and it will be fully justified <EOS>    PP Score = 9.439
<SOS> i also want to take up the subject of migration <EOS>    PP Score = 38.460
<SOS> mr nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with member states <EOS>    PP Score = 34.732
<SOS> nor is there coherence vis à vis the european taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the union s budget but the edf remains outside it <EOS>    PP Score = 6.038
<SOS> first the committee on development and cooperation advocates the communitisation of the edf clearly that is misguided <EOS>    PP Score = 44.863
<SOS> we believe that this is absolutely vital failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning europe s status in the international system <EOS>    PP Score = 15.912
<SOS> the next item is the statement by the council on eu priorities for the next session of the un human rights commission on <NUM> march <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 9.294
<SOS> in particular as agreed at the human rights council group on <NUM> february 200 the european union intends to table draft resolutions on the israeli settlements iran iraq sudan the democratic republic of the congo burma myanmar a draft chairman s statement on colombia and possibly on east timor together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries <EOS>    PP Score = 11.387
<SOS> it is therefore important this year too that the countries of the european union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution <EOS>    PP Score = 12.447
<SOS> discussions within the european union about the situation in china following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in <NUM> have led the european union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in china more firmly the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue while recognising the positive steps that china has made on the international stage <EOS>    PP Score = 9.896
<SOS> that does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference <EOS>    PP Score = 14.669
<SOS> i am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks <EOS>    PP Score = 10.346
<SOS> spurred on by amnesty international and others one of the first decisions i took as governor of hong kong was to abolish the death penalty <EOS>    PP Score = 2.561
<SOS> last year s debate in new york on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues <EOS>    PP Score = 7.378
<SOS> applause from the left heckling from the right <EOS>    PP Score = 8.119
<SOS> explanations of vote lienemann report a<MOB> 200 <EOS>    PP Score = 19.276
<SOS> mr president i voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because i believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the european parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 11.511
<SOS> da we oppose on principle the european community s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the member states <EOS>    PP Score = 6.706
<SOS> it is regrettable that due to the procedure the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session <EOS>    PP Score = 16.764
<SOS> i am convinced that the rapporteur s nationality has played a certain role which should not be of relevance in this parliament <EOS>    PP Score = 12.944
<SOS> basically we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but since the vote is only concerned with how and not to what extent these resources are to be used we have simply adopted a position on the issue <EOS>    PP Score = 9.505
<SOS> this means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated <EOS>    PP Score = 6.126
<SOS> the commission did not do that <EOS>    PP Score = 23.227
<SOS> i must say that i support these reduced deadlines especially as provision is made for derogations <EOS>    PP Score = 7.639
<SOS> i wish to put on the official record my concerns with the lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote <EOS>    PP Score = 26.621
<SOS> by failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant and is therefore not a problem from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity stifling the chances of any economic and social development we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon <EOS>    PP Score = 6.326
<SOS> the situation however is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation and uniform harmonisation into the bargain <EOS>    PP Score = 4.615
<SOS> this project with its social harmonisation does not constitute social policy instead it is an extension to the eu s emu project which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside emu and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship namely great britain sweden and denmark <EOS>    PP Score = 8.267
<SOS> in particular we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the commission s becoming involved in telling the member states what to do see for example paragraph 7 <EOS>    PP Score = 9.825
<SOS> we also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices chaos and waste <EOS>    PP Score = 3.387
<SOS> today a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking and the current systems are in the main run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual member states <EOS>    PP Score = 13.220
<SOS> el on reading the commission s statement on social protection which is animated by so many good intentions one wonders whether its authors and the working people in europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality <EOS>    PP Score = 12.519
<SOS> i believe that as a beginning parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the geneva session to narrow that divide it should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support <EOS>    PP Score = 8.063
<SOS> we must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished <EOS>    PP Score = 10.269
<SOS> in that sense we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law <EOS>    PP Score = 7.662
<SOS> they see forests being cut down and deserts spreading <EOS>    PP Score = 8.498
<SOS> this question does not challenge the efforts made by the member states who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere for example in china <EOS>    PP Score = 7.788
<SOS> leaders violating these principles now face international criticism sanctions and are even brought to trial such as ex dictators like mr pinochet have experienced <EOS>    PP Score = 2.313
<SOS> especially in situations of war civilians are given less consideration all the time <EOS>    PP Score = 4.850
<SOS> we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency <EOS>    PP Score = 7.703
<SOS> mr president i would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home <EOS>    PP Score = 7.607
<SOS> quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created <EOS>    PP Score = 9.290
<SOS> first of all civil society <EOS>    PP Score = 23.814
<SOS> mr president this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual un human rights convention and the commission s and council s efforts in this respect <EOS>    PP Score = 30.289
<SOS> in my opinion burma should be put back on the agenda too certainly in the wake of indonesia s u turn <EOS>    PP Score = 14.442
<SOS> it is impossible to talk about east timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of timorese refugees living on indonesian soil in inhumane conditions under the control of indonesian soldiers and militias and being used as bargaining chips <EOS>    PP Score = 6.838
<SOS> i was able to talk to prime minister bülent ecevit about this issue when i visited ankara myself and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with turkey s particular approach to this question i believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss <EOS>    PP Score = 12.121
<SOS> nevertheless i have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition which will evidently imply some concessions <EOS>    PP Score = 7.942
<SOS> however i also think that we in the eu should be making a constructive contribution <EOS>    PP Score = 52.729
<SOS> but we are also convinced that despite improved relations between the turkish and greek populations it is not enough <EOS>    PP Score = 12.967
<SOS> thirdly we must not in turn allow the position taken by the helsinki european council to temper our efforts to resolve the cypriot question before cyprus joins the union <EOS>    PP Score = 8.956
<SOS> a multiannual budget of the commission later on in the year may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years <EOS>    PP Score = 9.723
<SOS> as vaclav havel rightly said today the european union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual <EOS>    PP Score = 26.448
<SOS> nonetheless as far as the divided island of cyprus is concerned overall this pre accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge <EOS>    PP Score = 17.297
<SOS> mr alyssandrakis was translated as saying the confederate solution would be best <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 5.831
<SOS> now as regards the brok report cyprus and malta are the last of the mediterranean islands and unless i am mistaken the last islands anywhere in europe which have not acceded to the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 9.359
<SOS> the commission and the council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in cyprus to undertake joint projects <EOS>    PP Score = 10.225
<SOS> on the contrary i would say that although many areas of european policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence in this instance i would claim on behalf of the commission and the council that we have developed a very clear transparent and coherent policy <EOS>    PP Score = 8.634
<SOS> the vote will take place on thursday <EOS>    PP Score = 3.697
<SOS> if we stretched our imaginations we could envisage a situation where between now and next summer an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the algarve wreck the portuguese summer tourist industry with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of madeira because they move in that direction and furthermore wreck tourism in the canary islands as well <EOS>    PP Score = 3.772
<SOS> however the council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned <EOS>    PP Score = 8.358
<SOS> yet the sum of eur <NUM> million you mentioned had been given in 199 was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in kosovo especially where the provision of health services is concerned <EOS>    PP Score = 7.316
<SOS> and if we cannot solve the political problem which must be done in accordance with the relevant united nations resolution then we will not solve the problem of child health nor the various other problems faced by this region <EOS>    PP Score = 14.466
<SOS> but where will you place the emphasis <EOS>    PP Score = 6.021
<SOS> rapid action is called for <EOS>    PP Score = 35.960
<SOS> we are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising mr kouchner s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in kosovo especially as regards judicial structures and police cover <EOS>    PP Score = 10.445
<SOS> this is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a nato context but as the european union shares nato s view of these issues it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this i would like to make this clear on behalf of the council so that there can be no doubt <EOS>    PP Score = 18.056
<SOS> in my opinion the best thing the council could do would be to cease occupying that part of yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non intervention in the internal affairs of another independent country <EOS>    PP Score = 13.103
<SOS> it should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the milosevic regime <EOS>    PP Score = 6.511
<SOS> as a supplementary question i should like to ask you whether as the portuguese presidency you have made provision for the rights of children as such to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the charter <EOS>    PP Score = 20.476
<SOS> as i said mrs kratsa tsagaropoulou we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights <EOS>    PP Score = 12.921
<SOS> nevertheless i would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these member states was actually a set of actions of what i would call preventive political action at diplomatic level we feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which although it has become part of a european union government does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the union s aims <EOS>    PP Score = 11.438
<SOS> question no <NUM> by h 0044 00 <EOS>    PP Score = 2.549
<SOS> the court of auditors therefore already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role <EOS>    PP Score = 9.356
<SOS> question no <NUM> by h 0053 00 <EOS>    PP Score = 2.549
<SOS> will the portuguese presidency clarify its position on this matter <EOS>    PP Score = 25.363
<SOS> in fact shortly after the maastricht treaty was ratified you spoke in favour of strengthening european values creating a european ethical dimension and opening the union to the countries of central and eastern europe <EOS>    PP Score = 6.367
<SOS> i would like to see a number of changes to our assembly particularly after the signing of the new convention in may <EOS>    PP Score = 29.895
<SOS> for instance the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries which at present still have modest resources to move towards a global approach as opposed to globalisation <EOS>    PP Score = 6.309
<SOS> mr president it cannot be repeated often enough since 1975 the lomé convention has constituted an important pillar of european development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects <EOS>    PP Score = 7.669
<SOS> based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality and on parliamentary control by the joint assembly it is an example to the world <EOS>    PP Score = 31.320
<SOS> the lomé convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the eu and the acp countries for over <NUM> years <EOS>    PP Score = 19.545
<SOS> but of course the new convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the eu commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets <EOS>    PP Score = 22.051
<SOS> non least developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements <EOS>    PP Score = 19.293
<SOS> mr president what i want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of africa the caribbean and the pacific <EOS>    PP Score = 11.461
<SOS> it is my impression that this mission from the european parliament was the final push which convinced our cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 7.479
<SOS> ideally the european parliament s representatives should be able to support cuba s intent at those proceedings as our parliamentary colleagues from the acp countries will no doubt be doing <EOS>    PP Score = 12.065
<SOS> the first is about the fight against poverty which i think is becoming an embarrassment both for the eu and the member states <EOS>    PP Score = 13.218
<SOS> i think that is a very good idea indeed and i fully subscribe to it <EOS>    PP Score = 9.187
<SOS> in contrast to how things are done here in the european parliament and in parliament s committees where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the joint assembly the two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves <EOS>    PP Score = 9.076
<SOS> globalisation free trade and the hegemony of the wto with its internationalist philosophy were imperilling the very essence of the north south dialogue <EOS>    PP Score = 9.851
<SOS> for it is no small thing to have a minority of 33 or even 35 in one s own country <EOS>    PP Score = 14.237
<SOS> let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat although even in this regard i want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge commissioner patten s activities and interest in relation to fyrom and the region as a whole <EOS>    PP Score = 9.396
<SOS> secondly let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer fyrom accession to the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 7.896
<SOS> in the meantime we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for macedonian legislation to resemble that of the member states and our policy should reflect this even in the naming of aid programmes for macedonia <EOS>    PP Score = 10.413
<SOS> hence my support for the sound report by mr swoboda we have come to expect nothing less of him and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected republic of macedonia <EOS>    PP Score = 8.700
<SOS> this is the dual objective which i believe should be pursued on the one hand we must maintain programmes on for example infrastructure preparations still premature for free trade and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area and on the other it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia as an example of the policy <EOS>    PP Score = 14.220
<SOS> we are extremely hopeful that along the lines set out by the rapporteur mr swoboda this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries especially albania bosnia and herzegovina croatia montenegro and kosovo and as soon as possible serbia <EOS>    PP Score = 10.042
<SOS> is there any prospect of membership <EOS>    PP Score = 131.219
<SOS> mr president let me begin by saying that i have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle <EOS>    PP Score = 17.961
<SOS> that is why it is so important <EOS>    PP Score = 8.355
<SOS> mr president as one who has been concerned with macedonia for eight years i have to contradict mr dupuis <EOS>    PP Score = 12.748
<SOS> i believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country <EOS>    PP Score = 23.937
<SOS> as long as milosevic is still there and serbia is not pursuing a democratic path serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the balkans including in macedonia <EOS>    PP Score = 3.025
<SOS> i do however think it appropriate to say that at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement the european side must point out to the skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in new york <EOS>    PP Score = 19.924
<SOS> from that standpoint the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us any state any policy or any view impel that small republic towards external disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems granted let it be noted that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy <EOS>    PP Score = 4.232
<SOS> this has been a very interesting general debate about the balkans as a whole <EOS>    PP Score = 24.295
<SOS> mr president comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means <EOS>    PP Score = 15.319
<SOS> mr president i congratulate the rapporteur on her report <EOS>    PP Score = 9.338
<SOS> we confer implementing powers on the commission but then it is only a council or member state appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the commission and stop the implementing measure <EOS>    PP Score = 10.533
<SOS> that is lacking in this new system or at least is only there in embryonic form <EOS>    PP Score = 6.420
<SOS> it is good that the procedure exists <EOS>    PP Score = 17.732
<SOS> that is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in austria for the austrian people s party the övp wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability the övp wants to ensure that we continue to meet the maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit as we have agreed here <EOS>    PP Score = 15.633
<SOS> what we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable they already are but to make them more reliable and more comparable <EOS>    PP Score = 10.927
<SOS> so once again and finally i want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability <EOS>    PP Score = 6.545
<SOS> thank you very much commissioner solbes mira <EOS>    PP Score = 5.916
<SOS> it is that a currency that does not even exist yet that is not in circulation but exists only as bank deposit money can nevertheless be counterfeited already yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence <EOS>    PP Score = 7.539
<SOS> if we do not act promptly as mrs cederschiöld rightly said anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation <EOS>    PP Score = 3.426
<SOS> thank you for your attention during our night sitting together <EOS>    PP Score = 3.581
<SOS> but probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members the council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at european level a framework decision <EOS>    PP Score = 6.160
<SOS> for the commission has been asked to report as it will in the first half of next year on the progress in transposing it in the member states on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action <EOS>    PP Score = 30.712
<SOS> that is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use a large amount and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting <EOS>    PP Score = 10.924
<SOS> the sitting was closed at <NUM> p m <EOS>    PP Score = 2.776
<SOS> the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed <EOS>    PP Score = 3.512
<SOS> the purpose of the meeting which was attended by several vice presidents and quaestors together with the architects who designed this building was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions <EOS>    PP Score = 1.880
<SOS> there was a good deal of agreement within the committee apart from on a matter which too i hope it will be possible to solve <EOS>    PP Score = 16.694
<SOS> in the course of the 1980s most markets in europe underwent drastic deregulation as a result the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years <EOS>    PP Score = 3.984
<SOS> moving on now then to the point where there is or i hope was a lack of agreement namely otc derivatives <EOS>    PP Score = 5.295
<SOS> in recent years the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the member states <EOS>    PP Score = 5.489
<SOS> investment in otc derivatives however should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced <EOS>    PP Score = 5.244
<SOS> the rules for management companies for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations <EOS>    PP Score = 8.341
<SOS> in this regard too the committee is prepared to go further than the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 35.637
<SOS> the aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro <EOS>    PP Score = 19.501
<SOS> neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities automatically covered by these institutions <EOS>    PP Score = 3.409
<SOS> it seems to us that these limits are justified firstly by the need to diversify investments secondly because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time thirdly in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds <EOS>    PP Score = 7.860
<SOS> it is for this reason that despite the many omissions in the text the provisions set out therein could and i say could mr president be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens <EOS>    PP Score = 9.537
<SOS> not only should this be deleted the whole interception title should be scrapped <EOS>    PP Score = 9.072
<SOS> only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice <EOS>    PP Score = 7.328
<SOS> it is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in europe which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves <EOS>    PP Score = 9.572
<SOS> the term legale esterno has been translated into french as avocat neutre <NUM> i have no idea what an avocat neutre is <EOS>    PP Score = 14.973
<SOS> we shall address this problem and check all the translations <EOS>    PP Score = 12.971
<SOS> parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution <EOS>    PP Score = 5.795
<SOS> but i did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our group of the greens european free alliance you mentioned the greens on their own in every instance <EOS>    PP Score = 16.624
<SOS> this new move follows on from the step taken at the helsinki european council last december when it was decided that malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in february 200 i e by the end of this month in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the union and the adjustments required <EOS>    PP Score = 7.456
<SOS> however they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the european union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire <EOS>    PP Score = 15.821
<SOS> they should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation <EOS>    PP Score = 15.610
<SOS> the harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity <EOS>    PP Score = 7.033
<SOS> our policies in africa lack coherence <EOS>    PP Score = 36.879
<SOS> there is huge duplication of effort <EOS>    PP Score = 12.487
<SOS> mr prodi talks solely of mechanisms and structures and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people <EOS>    PP Score = 8.670
<SOS> even daring to refer to the defence of a european social model is a shamefaced lie because the more the eu combats the united states the more it becomes its clone <EOS>    PP Score = 8.870
<SOS> i hope that before the end of this new lomé convention we will be able to welcome cuba as a full member <EOS>    PP Score = 19.270
<SOS> the aids problem in africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one <EOS>    PP Score = 3.991
<SOS> it must be a development round in which developing countries effectively excluded from previous rounds are fully included <EOS>    PP Score = 2.944
<SOS> developing countries want trade not aid a help up not a hand out <EOS>    PP Score = 2.573
<SOS> fr the commission s stated desire to strengthen relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the community would appear to respond to a primary concern a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south east europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the second world war <EOS>    PP Score = 3.628
<SOS> exemplary because it proves that the balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the european union in stability and association agreements <EOS>    PP Score = 14.192
<SOS> the community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone and the uen group hopes that this signal to fyrom and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully paid up part of europe <EOS>    PP Score = 7.054
<SOS> the acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures <EOS>    PP Score = 1.629
<SOS> in some cases these operations were prepared well in advance fully involving workers representatives with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions <EOS>    PP Score = 3.636
<SOS> on every occasion and as recently as last october in this house the commission has highlighted the following basic positions <EOS>    PP Score = 15.873
<SOS> firstly decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management <EOS>    PP Score = 8.393
<SOS> we thank you for that <EOS>    PP Score = 91.488
<SOS> the commission sincerely hopes that parliament and the council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes in our view the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today <EOS>    PP Score = 11.300
<SOS> however it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant community legislation for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of italian and european public finances <EOS>    PP Score = 8.647
<SOS> it would be a serious matter if every non european company were to learn to use europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket you do not have to pay for cooperation you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone <EOS>    PP Score = 6.766
<SOS> as such state aid costs the government twice first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit <EOS>    PP Score = 8.078
<SOS> a company is pilloried one day and not the next <EOS>    PP Score = 9.447
<SOS> we meps speak often about smes and have now come up with a unique way of creating them <EOS>    PP Score = 7.295
<SOS> in this light i am pleased that mr liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion where the interests of employees are concerned with mrs diamantopoulou but we can involve the commissioners who are active in other fields <EOS>    PP Score = 13.591
<SOS> i would also like to advocate coherence in the commission s policy from these different vantage points unlike my predecessor who holds the belief that there is no need for rules <EOS>    PP Score = 4.803
<SOS> the closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty <EOS>    PP Score = 4.987
<SOS> he acknowledged that <NUM> million europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion <EOS>    PP Score = 15.861
<SOS> b<MOB> 200 by mr bautista ojeda and others on behalf of the group of the greens european free alliance on xenophobia related incidents in el ejido spain <EOS>    PP Score = 2.123
<SOS> the current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures as indicated previously <EOS>    PP Score = 13.809
<SOS> all decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents i am referring for example to the lack of agreement with morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry part of whose fleet is moored in almería <EOS>    PP Score = 8.026
<SOS> i am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the eu which is dominating relations between almería and morocco i am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions member states and european union which due to actions or omissions is leading to a few territories like almería having to support this migratory pressure from north west africa on their own <EOS>    PP Score = 5.704
<SOS> that is my conclusion today <EOS>    PP Score = 33.494
<SOS> this is occurring in my country despite the government the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens <EOS>    PP Score = 8.344
<SOS> violence begets violence and revenge begets revenge <EOS>    PP Score = 6.194
<SOS> the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept <EOS>    PP Score = 6.496
<SOS> it is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in angola <EOS>    PP Score = 10.607
<SOS> it is we our own people who keep the war going over there <EOS>    PP Score = 3.383
<SOS> another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the mpla government party <EOS>    PP Score = 9.220
<SOS> we should at any rate judge the portuguese presidency on its actions and not on its words <EOS>    PP Score = 24.285
<SOS> this is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time <EOS>    PP Score = 9.827
<SOS> the treatment of the native americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights <EOS>    PP Score = 29.072
<SOS> the deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries <EOS>    PP Score = 8.271
<SOS> yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war <EOS>    PP Score = 4.765
<SOS> the war in chechnya like any war is a trail of horrors <EOS>    PP Score = 14.776
<SOS> hence his disappearance of over one month <EOS>    PP Score = 8.597
<SOS> i do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced <EOS>    PP Score = 5.691
<SOS> these papers actively support the opposition politician mr sam rengie <EOS>    PP Score = 5.193
<SOS> the resolution i would love to have a debate on in parliament one day is on demining and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines stocks in the ukraine stocks in moldova and stocks elsewhere <EOS>    PP Score = 9.444
<SOS> finally on cambodia and the khmer rouge we strongly agree that senior khmer rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes <EOS>    PP Score = 14.454

<SOS> thank you very much commissioner patten <EOS>    PP Score = 4.379
<SOS> this disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a european union <EOS>    PP Score = 39.272
<SOS> today the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted which is why the european union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with community environmental protection standards <EOS>    PP Score = 11.228
<SOS> the efforts already being made need to be stepped up <EOS>    PP Score = 16.915
<SOS> it has already been banned in most eu countries for a long time now <EOS>    PP Score = 12.824
<SOS> it is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it <EOS>    PP Score = 14.650
<SOS> it would be appropriate therefore to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of union citizens and the desirability in both economic and social terms of promoting the european tourist industry <EOS>    PP Score = 6.385
<SOS> we must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age <EOS>    PP Score = 7.253
<SOS> the commission and parliament are called upon to answer two questions what are the right conditions and what is the role of the european union on this <EOS>    PP Score = 9.293
<SOS> when it comes to tourism we can no longer do what we like where we like <EOS>    PP Score = 7.200
<SOS> i can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector <EOS>    PP Score = 11.470
<SOS> their expertise is of course superior to that of the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 6.945
<SOS> he has convinced me of that <EOS>    PP Score = 18.497
<SOS> in view of all this i think it is a serious contradiction that there is no european policy on tourism <EOS>    PP Score = 26.038
<SOS> what expectations does the commissioner have that the new intergovernmental conference which is starting will include this aspect <EOS>    PP Score = 9.289
<SOS> this will also be important with a view to the special summit in march where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment <EOS>    PP Score = 11.965
<SOS> the new strategy outlined by the commission communication on tourism and employment and agreed by the council places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice <EOS>    PP Score = 17.571
<SOS> as regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism <EOS>    PP Score = 10.014

<SOS> mr president the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 16.919
<SOS> the commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector <EOS>    PP Score = 8.433
<SOS> the aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 12.694
<SOS> we have now been waiting in vain for <NUM> months for the commission to put forward proposals so i should be grateful if the commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new modern europe wide postal system <EOS>    PP Score = 9.494
<SOS> it is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and moreover because it will lead to lower prices all that we are assured will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market <EOS>    PP Score = 8.862
<SOS> it is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 15.310
<SOS> however since commissioner monti is here i would like him to take a message back to commissioner bolkestein telling him what the postal services directive was about <EOS>    PP Score = 9.291
<SOS> is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly because for example the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically <EOS>    PP Score = 6.829
<SOS> like mr miller i would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the <NUM> directive within the next couple of months or weeks or if at all possible within the next couple of days <EOS>    PP Score = 21.553
<SOS> there are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job <EOS>    PP Score = 18.116
<SOS> i shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing i think we all still remember them <EOS>    PP Score = 6.267
<SOS> or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations <EOS>    PP Score = 6.428
<SOS> members should however represent all the citizens which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy <EOS>    PP Score = 10.331
<SOS> in practice that means the following for the postal services firstly priority must be given to employment <EOS>    PP Score = 16.034
<SOS> examples in germany and sweden show that this certainly is a risk <EOS>    PP Score = 7.315
<SOS> it may be supposed for example as commissioner bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on <NUM> september last year that the commission might propose reducing these limits to <NUM> grams and two and a half times the basic tariff <EOS>    PP Score = 5.083
<SOS> the second scenario which we prefer to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper detailed objective study of the effects of the <NUM> directive <EOS>    PP Score = 18.114
<SOS> most assuredly i would like to be able to say that the examples i observe every day in my own country and in my own region a very rural one convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation <EOS>    PP Score = 9.730
<SOS> mr president we are therefore wondering and we ask the commission although of course mr bolkestein is not here but mr monti is a man of many parts and i think he may have a view on this should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each and i repeat on each one of the european union s member states <EOS>    PP Score = 8.600
<SOS> the existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors <EOS>    PP Score = 32.294
<SOS> such companies have always been around but they used to be banned whereas these days they are being heralded as progress <EOS>    PP Score = 12.171
<SOS> of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage because they are so densely distributed throughout europe <EOS>    PP Score = 21.955
<SOS> as politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests <EOS>    PP Score = 33.138
<SOS> yet i believe that as this debate has shown we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas <EOS>    PP Score = 37.545
<SOS> i am most grateful to the commissioner for his plain talking today and i would ask the commission to force the pace now <EOS>    PP Score = 28.254
<SOS> today s debate makes it quite clear that parliament wants more emphasis on speed not speed at the expense of quality but then slowness alone does not mean quality either <EOS>    PP Score = 13.809
<SOS> competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation before <NUM> january <NUM> because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates <EOS>    PP Score = 9.216
<SOS> it is already employed widely in the transport sector <EOS>    PP Score = 19.073
<SOS> as regards the existing directive and its implementation most member states have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive <EOS>    PP Score = 9.819
<SOS> nevertheless mr bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision making process <EOS>    PP Score = 11.463
<SOS> mr medina ortega i am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise through unchecked concentration to private operators <EOS>    PP Score = 6.595
<SOS> they clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email <EOS>    PP Score = 29.560
<SOS> parliament has completed the agenda <EOS>    PP Score = 32.068
<SOS> thirdly we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people <EOS>    PP Score = 4.962
<SOS> i think that the house can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every member state in seeking to get information or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the commission <EOS>    PP Score = 7.058
<SOS> on the second part of mr harbour s question he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the commission as the president briefly outlined in his statement <EOS>    PP Score = 11.136
<SOS> we indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and i believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously <EOS>    PP Score = 13.851
<SOS> i am grateful to mrs maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this house <EOS>    PP Score = 7.629
<SOS> i think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks <EOS>    PP Score = 4.334
<SOS> financial control will be absolutely secured both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes and because we will introduce a completely professional independent internal audit service <EOS>    PP Score = 6.765
<SOS> as i said earlier our ambition is total security for money and value for money <EOS>    PP Score = 3.627
<SOS> so the changes that we seek to make as i say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the committee of independent experts are not negative in any way at all <EOS>    PP Score = 10.577
<SOS> but on this issue i do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this house and in the council <EOS>    PP Score = 8.734
<SOS> i am grateful to the honourable member for underlining the fact that apart from its own inherent merits reform will be made necessary by accession the enlargements and particularly the kind of enlargements that our union will shortly be engaging in <EOS>    PP Score = 10.460
<SOS> all i can do now is to promise to strive for it <EOS>    PP Score = 36.496
<SOS> is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to european funding whilst ensuring financial control <EOS>    PP Score = 4.721
<SOS> these are the opening of the intergovernmental conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 8.218
<SOS> this basically involves relations between the european union and the atlantic alliance and relations between the european union and those countries which although geographically in europe are not part of the european union or at least not at the moment <EOS>    PP Score = 11.252
<SOS> i will set this out in five points <EOS>    PP Score = 5.895
<SOS> madam president i have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months <EOS>    PP Score = 25.335
<SOS> i am not going to say much more on these issues <EOS>    PP Score = 25.157
<SOS> thank you very much indeed mr solana i shall now give the floor to mr poettering on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats <EOS>    PP Score = 7.134
<SOS> on behalf of the commission commissioner patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction <EOS>    PP Score = 26.538
<SOS> there is one thing i shall again finally emphasise that the purpose of all this is of course that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all <EOS>    PP Score = 8.402
<SOS> i am in favour of a hardline policy against austria but we shall then have a responsibility towards russia <EOS>    PP Score = 16.451
<SOS> i believe that european defence should be scrutinised by the european parliament and by the national parliaments <EOS>    PP Score = 7.492
<SOS> a foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one s own interests <EOS>    PP Score = 6.596
<SOS> in kosovo it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in serbia <EOS>    PP Score = 2.692
<SOS> as candidate countries of the european union they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning that is to say as of now <EOS>    PP Score = 12.209
<SOS> i should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the what is to be done variety <EOS>    PP Score = 18.705
<SOS> over the past couple of months high representative solana and commissioner patten have during discussions among other things with members of the nato assembly tried to separate the defence policies of the eu and nato <EOS>    PP Score = 7.241
<SOS> one gets the impression in fact that they both think that the petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the eu defence policy in due course <EOS>    PP Score = 14.997
<SOS> however this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on going intergovernmental conference even further <EOS>    PP Score = 12.808
<SOS> do you really think that the governments of the union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them apparently at least have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends <EOS>    PP Score = 14.926
<SOS> the level of practical assistance from the community and from the member states has been pathetic <EOS>    PP Score = 29.762
<SOS> what we need are <NUM> <NUM> civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations <EOS>    PP Score = 20.033
<SOS> these are not only of concern to the defence minister mr scharping instead they also affect the whole of europe <EOS>    PP Score = 14.762
<SOS> we need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well <EOS>    PP Score = 2.805
<SOS> we are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise <EOS>    PP Score = 17.779
<SOS> we face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles <EOS>    PP Score = 17.245
<SOS> future generations of women must not be sidelined <EOS>    PP Score = 58.165
<SOS> in fact 45 of the danish government is made up of women and that is in reality a touch more than in finland <EOS>    PP Score = 26.265
<SOS> we all know to what extent women are under represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves <EOS>    PP Score = 10.606
<SOS> if we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen <EOS>    PP Score = 52.641
<SOS> finally i want to say as commissioner patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother <EOS>    PP Score = 5.742
<SOS> with such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions <EOS>    PP Score = 11.178
<SOS> the policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs <EOS>    PP Score = 3.631
<SOS> ladies have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota <EOS>    PP Score = 10.391
<SOS> if we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision making bodies it is clear that we are still far from true democracy <EOS>    PP Score = 10.952
<SOS> it is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the council the commission and each member state strictly to respect the commitments they have made particularly at the beijing conference <EOS>    PP Score = 15.064
<SOS> quite simply i would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and i am particularly against the system of quotas because i believe it is especially contemptuous of women and i come from a country where parity has just been achieved <EOS>    PP Score = 16.576
<SOS> an important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women s full participation in power structures and decision making <EOS>    PP Score = 4.887
<SOS> women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under represented in peace keeping efforts conflict resolution and reconstruction work <EOS>    PP Score = 8.328
<SOS> we therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities and the great challenge confronting all europeans now and particularly women concerns the new economy and the new information technologies <EOS>    PP Score = 12.212
<SOS> athena the goddess of wisdom and war may have been a female model in ancient greece but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace <EOS>    PP Score = 2.478
<SOS> and how should we achieve this <EOS>    PP Score = 62.135
<SOS> because they have a different level of education <EOS>    PP Score = 50.411
<SOS> finally on the question of whether as the product of quotas we can be proud i would reply categorically that i would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that i had managed to impose quotas on greece where the level of representation of women is 5 <EOS>    PP Score = 12.751
<SOS> the commission is following with very great concern as i know all honourable members will be the emergency situation in mozambique <EOS>    PP Score = 11.031
<SOS> secondly that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society <EOS>    PP Score = 7.464
<SOS> we talked about the importance of the commission developing a series of headline goals for non military actions related to crises and if i may say so if ever there was a case where that is relevant it is the disaster which has overwhelmed mozambique <EOS>    PP Score = 7.997
<SOS> although these floods began three weeks ago the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits mozambique currently finds itself in there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport particularly air transport to get them out of the situation they are in <EOS>    PP Score = 4.804
<SOS> it is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way <EOS>    PP Score = 12.554
<SOS> apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about <NUM> <NUM> people from trees <EOS>    PP Score = 18.235
<SOS> and this is happening in a country which because it is one of the poorest in the world does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary <EOS>    PP Score = 16.900
<SOS> this would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all <EOS>    PP Score = 11.078
<SOS> most of us here would not wish to boast about eur <NUM> million <EOS>    PP Score = 16.841
<SOS> there is indeed economic recovery but it only marginally reduces unemployment in europe <EOS>    PP Score = 10.501
<SOS> a tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the internet <EOS>    PP Score = 5.282
<SOS> mr president i think that this policy will engender not hope but deep disappointment in european workers <EOS>    PP Score = 3.927
<SOS> the vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the european commission ecofin and the central bank but also the european parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the member states of the european union <EOS>    PP Score = 10.356
<SOS> even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high level experts who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas failed miserably to muster any support <EOS>    PP Score = 8.815
<SOS> why for example was the proposal to increase europe s active population to 75 of the total population removed when we currently have levels of around 60 <EOS>    PP Score = 7.057
<SOS> an active population of 60 is very low compared with that of japan or the united states and we cannot match those countries levels of production with such a low rate of employment <EOS>    PP Score = 7.142
<SOS> as far as i am concerned emu cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy <EOS>    PP Score = 3.412
<SOS> we all agree that after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment certain action must be taken <EOS>    PP Score = 4.676
<SOS> so is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other <EOS>    PP Score = 15.914
<SOS> to take first the proposal for the council regulation this makes provision for member states to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations <EOS>    PP Score = 5.184
<SOS> it is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole <EOS>    PP Score = 8.724
<SOS> amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority <EOS>    PP Score = 6.379
<SOS> mr president i believe we totally agree with mrs attwooll s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two commission proposals intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio economic situation of the fisheries sector come at a critical time <EOS>    PP Score = 19.145
<SOS> the proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner <EOS>    PP Score = 21.007
<SOS> i am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our group has no difficulty in supporting these reports <EOS>    PP Score = 11.777
<SOS> i sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the irish sea and at that very time haddock had a special spectacular increase of breeding in the irish sea so the scientists can be wrong <EOS>    PP Score = 2.267
<SOS> this is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming <EOS>    PP Score = 10.576
<SOS> i am advised that isa is considered non pathogenic for humans and mammals <EOS>    PP Score = 6.993
<SOS> i therefore am not able to accept amendment no <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 49.193
<SOS> we remain committed to eradicating the disease an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon farming sector <EOS>    PP Score = 9.178
<SOS> iccat also made recommendations in 1974 <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>    PP Score = 5.027
<SOS> the commission s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna <EOS>    PP Score = 13.196
<SOS> indeed it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources <EOS>    PP Score = 8.684
<SOS> our rapporteur s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded <EOS>    PP Score = 6.896
<SOS> however according to the scrs study the regulation establishing the <NUM> kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the east atlantic and mediterranean fisheries <EOS>    PP Score = 7.056
<SOS> the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> a m <EOS>    PP Score = 2.222
<SOS> thank you very much commissioner fischler <EOS>    PP Score = 4.379
<SOS> after all the treaties have stipulated since <NUM> that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into community policies <EOS>    PP Score = 38.976
<SOS> i do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea and particularly in a closed environment like the mediterranean when we want to clean up purification plants is a good way to clean up water <EOS>    PP Score = 5.553
<SOS> the use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore as well as in coastal waters <EOS>    PP Score = 6.654
<SOS> pt mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all the commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the <NUM> convention on insolvency proceedings <EOS>    PP Score = 17.340
<SOS> the second point relates to the future and the publication of the commission s white paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce european environmental legislation properly <EOS>    PP Score = 10.590
<SOS> it is recognised in that white paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two <EOS>    PP Score = 3.661
<SOS> mr president our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster but good intentions are not enough there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment <EOS>    PP Score = 10.652
<SOS> this means that the <NUM> <NUM> tonnes of cargo released into the sea include <NUM> tonnes of highly toxic products <EOS>    PP Score = 13.262
<SOS> the french state has released funds for compensating damage <EOS>    PP Score = 5.770
<SOS> all workers in the fishing fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard <EOS>    PP Score = 25.906
