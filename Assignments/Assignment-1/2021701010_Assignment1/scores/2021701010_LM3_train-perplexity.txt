<SOS> in current textbooks of dermatology lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology <EOS>    PP Score = 7.345
<SOS> when this concept was developed there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid <EOS>    PP Score = 8.863
<SOS> it is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins as it is in systemic amyloidoses but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes <EOS>    PP Score = 5.186
