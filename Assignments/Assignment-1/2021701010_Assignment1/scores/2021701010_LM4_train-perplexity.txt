<SOS> in a random sample of <NUM> hospital in patients aged <NUM> and over the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed <EOS>    PP Score = 2.988
<SOS> questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire <EOS>    PP Score = 3.866
<SOS> migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature <EOS>    PP Score = 2.793
<SOS> we present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of <NUM> years <EOS>    PP Score = 2.422
<SOS> most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended <EOS>    PP Score = 2.452
<SOS> neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth <EOS>    PP Score = 2.987
<SOS> in atopic eczema patients the well known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels white dermographism delayed blanch after acetylcholine paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema free state in comparison with controls <EOS>    PP Score = 2.128
<SOS> in this follow up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema <EOS>    PP Score = 3.450
<SOS> severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema free cutaneous state <EOS>    PP Score = 2.808
<SOS> we report on a 9 year old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall <EOS>    PP Score = 3.117
<SOS> this rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life <EOS>    PP Score = 4.440
<SOS> the typical clinical presentation is a solitary usually 2 6 cm large non tender mass of blue greyish colour which is mostly located on the back anterior chest wall thigh or groin <EOS>    PP Score = 2.246
<SOS> characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo or epithelium and relatively small multinucleated cells floret cells <EOS>    PP Score = 2.374
<SOS> the recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins <EOS>    PP Score = 3.037
<SOS> it is of pre eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy <EOS>    PP Score = 3.280
<SOS> to correct severe septal deformities it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft <EOS>    PP Score = 2.359
<SOS> the utilization of a compound graft which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon pds foil facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum <EOS>    PP Score = 2.279
<SOS> stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females <EOS>    PP Score = 5.016
<SOS> the usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral <EOS>    PP Score = 3.183
<SOS> two competitive techniques bladder neck suspension in accordance with stamey and colposuspension in accordance with burch were retrospectively investigated <EOS>    PP Score = 2.903
<SOS> a total of <NUM> women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in <NUM> and <NUM> total 76 patients respectively <EOS>    PP Score = 4.417
<SOS> initially both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate 91 3 and <NUM> resp <EOS>    PP Score = 3.227
<SOS> however the continence rate of the stamey patients deteriorated after <NUM> weeks down to <NUM> and after more than <NUM> years only <NUM> of these patients were still completely continent mean follow up <NUM> mths whereas deterioration in the burch patients was only <NUM> mean follow up <NUM> mths <EOS>    PP Score = 3.104
<SOS> the disappointing results with the stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence <EOS>    PP Score = 3.863
<SOS> it was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression <EOS>    PP Score = 3.800
<SOS> the three cases of recurring incontinence after burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery <EOS>    PP Score = 3.410
<SOS> with respect to long term follow up our results with the stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the burch technique <EOS>    PP Score = 3.591
<SOS> therefore in our opinion the burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence <EOS>    PP Score = 3.684
<SOS> this paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders an issue being neglected in german psychiatry for a long time <EOS>    PP Score = 2.499
<SOS> social inequality will be discussed in it is dimensions socioeconomic status and sex referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge <EOS>    PP Score = 2.779
<SOS> because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level <EOS>    PP Score = 2.395
<SOS> these concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur <EOS>    PP Score = 3.733
<SOS> a short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change <EOS>    PP Score = 2.270
<SOS> further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure and last but not least a gender sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated <EOS>    PP Score = 2.277
<SOS> it is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation although influences on the voice are not assumed <EOS>    PP Score = 2.639
<SOS> in addition to the vocal fundamental frequency vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones <EOS>    PP Score = 3.259
<SOS> through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway resonances and antiresonances are formed and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent <EOS>    PP Score = 2.933
<SOS> nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely <EOS>    PP Score = 3.025
<SOS> the influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses <EOS>    PP Score = 3.754
<SOS> the fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture <EOS>    PP Score = 2.255
<SOS> when the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture <EOS>    PP Score = 2.772
<SOS> sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position <EOS>    PP Score = 3.751
<SOS> this change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture <EOS>    PP Score = 3.157
<SOS> in this situation increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies <EOS>    PP Score = 2.346
<SOS> these findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases <EOS>    PP Score = 3.240
<SOS> the etiology of this occurrence is still not clear <EOS>    PP Score = 5.341
<SOS> its consequences however should be known to the dentist ent surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures <EOS>    PP Score = 2.162
<SOS> cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure as a function of severity of disease <EOS>    PP Score = 3.470
<SOS> the source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research <EOS>    PP Score = 2.833
<SOS> potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself <EOS>    PP Score = 1.982
<SOS> in addition anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the neuroanesthesia study group of the german society of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine dgai published in <NUM> were investigated and compared to results of a <NUM> survey <EOS>    PP Score = 3.031
