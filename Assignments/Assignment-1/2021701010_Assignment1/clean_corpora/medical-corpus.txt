<SOS> active glucocorticoids gcs such as cortisol or corticosterone are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung <EOS>
<SOS> in fetal serum biologically inactive metabolites cortisone or 11 dehydrocorticosterone outweigh the active forms <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11 hsd regulates the intracellular activation of gcs <EOS>
<SOS> the inhibition of 11 hsd by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand gcs induce the reductive activity of 11 hsd and therefore they increase their own activation by positive feedback <EOS>
<SOS> in a community sample of <NUM> eldery aged <NUM> years and older from east and west germany diseases contacts with general practitioners and specialists the use of medicine attitudes regarding health and illness the subjective health psychic problems social support social integration social burden and socio demographic variables were assessed <EOS>
<SOS> based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> the results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person <EOS>
<SOS> in nearly 10 of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time <EOS>
<SOS> 88 had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year 97 had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year <EOS>
<SOS> 55 8 took at least one medicine each day <EOS>
<SOS> the number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree and if they rated their own health as poor <EOS>
<SOS> fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful that had low control beliefs regarding their own health and that experienced only a low degree of health related limitations in their everyday life <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant age related or sex related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine <EOS>
<SOS> inflammatory bowel diseases ibd crohn is disease ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue <EOS>
<SOS> recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of ibd <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of ibd and the postoperative recurrence of crohn is disease <EOS>
<SOS> based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ibd several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice including recombinant anti inflammatory cytokines ifn il 10 il 11 and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules icam proinflammatory cytokines tnf il 12 and their receptors tnf il 6r <EOS>
<SOS> dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus sle <EOS>
<SOS> a defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response <EOS>
<SOS> experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and c1q knock out mice suggest an important role of c1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there are several links between c1q and sle most the patients with c1q deficiency develop a sle like syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> sle itself often causes secondary c1q deficiency and autoantibodies to c1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis <EOS>
<SOS> these observations suggest a central role of c1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of sle <EOS>
<SOS> objective the aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention <EOS>
<SOS> the discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now <EOS>
<SOS> the rate at which telemedical applications are being developed leaves little time for consideration of the economic scientific and social aspects <EOS>

<SOS> different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> a 34 year old woman who was separated from her husband was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest <EOS>
<SOS> the post mortem examination was carried out approximately <NUM> h after death <EOS>
<SOS> at the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken <EOS>
<SOS> additionally a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo neck pullover <EOS>
<SOS> it was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim <EOS>
<SOS> dna typing short tandem repeat pcr of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self reinforced absorbable composites biofix in the fixation of ankle fractures <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard a o fixation <EOS>
<SOS> the benefits of biofix rods and screws are a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed prevention of stress shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity <EOS>
<SOS> patients aged between <NUM> and <NUM> years old with closed non comminuted fractures of the lateral and or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean <NUM> mm were included in the study <EOS>
<SOS> 22 patients were treated with biofix rods and screws and the control group of <NUM> patients with a standard technique <EOS>
<SOS> after 3 <NUM> and <NUM> months rontgenograms were taken <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of olerud and molander <EOS>
<SOS> two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non medical reasons <EOS>
<SOS> 22 patients 12 from the biofix group <NUM> from the ao group operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases a biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion <EOS>
<SOS> this did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture <EOS>
<SOS> there were no early post operative complications <EOS>
<SOS> the functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal <EOS>
<SOS> in three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion <EOS>
<SOS> biofix rods and screws made of polylactic acid are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle <EOS>
<SOS> the use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the long term results are good <EOS>
<SOS> there is however a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material <EOS>
<SOS> in current textbooks of dermatology lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology <EOS>
<SOS> when this concept was developed there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid <EOS>
<SOS> it is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins as it is in systemic amyloidoses but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes <EOS>
<SOS> even several years ago chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus <EOS>
<SOS> in support of this hypothesis four cases are presented <EOS>
<SOS> apart from amyloid in the papillary layer all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus <EOS>
<SOS> lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions <EOS>
<SOS> just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions <EOS>
<SOS> consequently treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid but at improving the pruritus <EOS>
<SOS> ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency especially in postthrombotic syndrome are often resistant to compression therapy <EOS>
<SOS> they can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by humby knife shave therapy and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins yields very good success rates <EOS>
<SOS> the results in <NUM> patients 18 legs with an average follow up period of <NUM> months up to <NUM> months are reported <EOS>
<SOS> the literature from <MOB> and <NUM> personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites <EOS>
<SOS> bites of the adder vipera berus are rare <EOS>
<SOS> symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution death due to adder bite is rare <EOS>
<SOS> the main venom effect is the development of sometimes severe edema hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure <EOS>
<SOS> significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2 3 h after the incident no signs of intoxication can be found <EOS>

<SOS> in two cases an increase in qtc time was observed severe bradycardia was also observed twice <EOS>
<SOS> objective cultural detection of bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough since culture takes three to five days until results are available and only about 30 60 of patients may be detected by this method <EOS>
<SOS> in order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction pcr were developed <EOS>
<SOS> with the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the <NUM> diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro oculographic technique <EOS>
<SOS> to answer this question we compared mean slow phase velocity spv using three different recording techniques electro oculography eog video oculography vog and infra red oculography irog during four different types of examinations <EOS>
<SOS> the examinations were the eye target tracking test ett horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus okn tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo ocular reflex hvor <EOS>
<SOS> for the ett tests the vog provided consistently higher mean spv values with low variance presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration <EOS>
<SOS> for the horizontal okn and vor rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean spv obtained with the different recording techniques although the irog recordings were associated with a larger variance <EOS>
<SOS> vertical okn mean spv was consistently lower with irog and vog techniques presumably because of non linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques <EOS>
<SOS> these results indicate that the eog technique despite its disadvantages of noise time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive reliable and accurate means of measuring slow phase eye movements <EOS>
<SOS> aim the aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sicam 1 and se selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity <EOS>

<SOS> thoracic disc herniation is rare <EOS>
<SOS> pain is the most common initial symptom followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement <EOS>
<SOS> by the time of diagnosis 90 of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression <EOS>
<SOS> a 42 year old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain <EOS>
<SOS> during her stay in hospital the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the t10 11 disc <EOS>
<SOS> degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture <EOS>
<SOS> aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods antibodies against laminin with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> the blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries <EOS>
<SOS> blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network <EOS>
<SOS> compared to the surrounding synovial layer the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> the distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous <EOS>
<SOS> the anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo tendinous junction to the patella <EOS>
<SOS> within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app <EOS>
<SOS> 30 mm in length and app <EOS>
<SOS> within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative <EOS>
<SOS> an explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region <EOS>
<SOS> when looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration bec in artificially respirated patients consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed bec measuring device as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system were examined in a lung model <EOS>
<SOS> total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following le fort i osteotomy in clp patients are frequent and major complications <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement <EOS>
<SOS> maxillary distraction was performed in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases a delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by polley <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved one partial relapse occurred <EOS>
<SOS> the results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability <EOS>
<SOS> the technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> we report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult <EOS>
<SOS> a huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62 year old man <EOS>
<SOS> the patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until <NUM> days before admission to hospital <EOS>
<SOS> histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered homer wright rosettes <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with o13 a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30 32mic2 <EOS>
<SOS> focally tumour cells stained positively for vimentin nse s 100 protein and synaptophysin <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died <NUM> weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumours in this location is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes <EOS>
<SOS> in a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements <EOS>
<SOS> severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum <EOS>
<SOS> then rotation of the femoral neck and or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15 20 <NUM> ° of anteversion are indicated <EOS>
<SOS> our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy <EOS>
<SOS> it is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20 30 <NUM> ° anteriorly from the frontal coronal plane <EOS>
<SOS> the osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension <EOS>
<SOS> our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain <EOS>
<SOS> the optimum is reached with a ce angle and a vca angle of 30 35 <NUM> ° an angle of the weight bearing zone of 5 to 5 <NUM> ° and a migration index of 10 15 <EOS>
<SOS> overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards <NUM> <NUM> ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15 20 <NUM> ° of anteversion <EOS>
<SOS> in earlier follow ups of <NUM> hips 5 10 years postoperatively <NUM> of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis <EOS>
<SOS> survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about <NUM> <EOS>

<SOS> heparin induced thrombocytopenia type ii hit type ii is an immunoglobulin mediated drug induced side effect for heparin treated patients with thromboembolic complications <EOS>
<SOS> with an incidence of 1 3 mortality of <NUM> it and permanent disability for another <NUM> is a clinically relevant disorder <EOS>
<SOS> with heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> with hit type ii the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system <EOS>
<SOS> if hit type ii is suspected further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started <EOS>
<SOS> the two anticoagulant options in germany are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing including testing for cross reactivity with danaparoid <EOS>
<SOS> further therapy depends on the symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low molecular weight heparin lmwh for routine prophylaxis use of lmwh for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine <EOS>
<SOS> a patented low temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate mma infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described it has been developed from our previous mma technique and is a patented procedure <EOS>
<SOS> differences from the previous method are 1 removal of stabilizer from the mma monomer before its application 2 the use of a different starter 3 avoidance of o2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with n2 and 4 polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat <EOS>
<SOS> after this procedure all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate <EOS>
<SOS> the effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis <EOS>
<SOS> technically this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification <EOS>
<SOS> the advantages over the latter method are 1 the cells can be better differentiated because semi thin sections can be made 2 the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi thin sections which means they can be interpreted more easily 3 morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections 4 osteological examination of bone trabeculae especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies is possible 5 the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below dm 100 00 including an excellent microtome <EOS>
<SOS> the routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned <EOS>
<SOS> initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions <EOS>
<SOS> however most of these initial studies either did not have a double blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants <EOS>
<SOS> in this study intubation conditions using fentanyl propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl propofol succinylcholine and sodium thiopental succinylcholine <EOS>
<SOS> nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients <EOS>
<SOS> the endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense <EOS>
<SOS> common nosocomial pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action <EOS>
<SOS> multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes which represents a permanent source of infectious material <EOS>
<SOS> endotracheal tubes removed from patients with ventilator associated pneumonia are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls <EOS>
<SOS> it remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination <EOS>
<SOS> bacterial biofilm however may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient <EOS>
<SOS> computer guided robot assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3d workstation orthodoc <EOS>

<SOS> in all <NUM> patients the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the high precision in reaming leading to a superb bone implant contact guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone <EOS>
<SOS> the common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of robodoc <EOS>
<SOS> although immediate full weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients no implant subsidence was seen in the regular follow up x ray studies <EOS>

<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> at the bergmannsheil ruhr university hospital in bochum germany we treated <NUM> patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> of these patients <NUM> received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution <EOS>
<SOS> the primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in <NUM> cases reamed nails in <NUM> cases and external fixators in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the average age of the patients was <NUM> years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> twenty seven patients 19 presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and <NUM> 81 with an atrophic nonunion <EOS>

<SOS> we observed <NUM> wound infections 23 with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis <EOS>
<SOS> we determined that <NUM> of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques <EOS>
<SOS> of these cases <NUM> involved the use of plates <NUM> involved the use of reamed nails and <NUM> involved the use of external fixators <EOS>
<SOS> fracture location near the diaphyseal metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group <EOS>
<SOS> ninety two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> open fractures and of these <NUM> n 19 developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and <NUM> n 6 developed a wound infection <EOS>
<SOS> fifty seven 39 of all patients had additional injuries but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing <EOS>
<SOS> our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections refreshment of bone healing and improvement in fragment stability <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> of all classic plates and <NUM> of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery <EOS>
<SOS> hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of <NUM> revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of <NUM> revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions <EOS>
<SOS> since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative x rays we recommend that revision procedures be performed early <EOS>

<SOS> background in a prospective trial october <NUM> april 1998 the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after r0 resection was evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> methods patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with <NUM> µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen <NUM> mg once daily <EOS>
<SOS> the median survival time quality of life eortc qlq 30 and side effects of the octreotide tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort n 14 of patients treated in our department 9 95 9 96 according to the best supportive care concept <EOS>
<SOS> results recurrences were diagnosed after r0 resection in a mean time of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly p 0 05 longer median survival time 7 months range 3 12 vs <NUM> months range 1 5 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the octreotide tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite nausea fatigue and pain and needed fewer analgesies <EOS>
<SOS> the only side effect of the octreotide tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in <NUM> patients at the beginning of the therapy <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer <EOS>
<SOS> objective to study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one lung ventilation olv <EOS>
<SOS> design prospective randomised placebo controlled study <EOS>
<SOS> patients twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthesia general anaesthesia was performed using propofol fentanyl n2o and <URL> ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period <EOS>
<SOS> during olv the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding <NUM> cm h2o <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the fio2 was increased to 1 0 and the external peep was removed during olv <EOS>
<SOS> interventions the patients received either dopexamine at <NUM> µg kg min group a n 10 or 0 9 saline as control group b n 10 after assessing the baseline values <EOS>
<SOS> measurement and results the following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded heart rate mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure <EOS>

<SOS> 78 of the women always used condoms while <NUM> thought that condoms prevent stds <EOS>
<SOS> three women suffered from a std in the last <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the majority the women 75 from this <NUM> prostitutes did not perceive the examination as discrimination while <NUM> felt the examinations were of high quality <EOS>
<SOS> these results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women <EOS>
<SOS> atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> as more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again <EOS>
<SOS> there are some unresolved problems of this complication <EOS>
<SOS> reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature <EOS>
<SOS> usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient self limiting and benign <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless among patients affected by this arrhythmia morbidity mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication <EOS>
<SOS> in addition postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself <EOS>
<SOS> today general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future <EOS>
<SOS> according to the clinical course therapy has to consider ventricular rate control prevention of thromboembolic events and rhythm control <EOS>
<SOS> usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time <EOS>
<SOS> atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate <EOS>
<SOS> there are doubts in emergency operations especially in transplant patients concerning dosage and change in medication <EOS>
<SOS> our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in german transplantation centres <EOS>
<SOS> the question of transplant suitability dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature <EOS>
<SOS> some <NUM> of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in <NUM> of the centres <EOS>
<SOS> an increased mortality has not been reported <EOS>
<SOS> most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of <NUM> mg aspirin daily <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin treated patients <EOS>
<SOS> correctly indicated aspirin treatment for cardiac arrhythmia embolism or thrombosis for example does not contraindicate renal transplantation daily dosage up to <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> in elective surgery however a preoperative change in medication is recommended e g the heparin instead of aspirin <EOS>
<SOS> full thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient specific treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities is presented and critically discussed <EOS>
<SOS> incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation aea and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia cse for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> this retrospective study presents the results of <NUM> patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the staatliche orthopädische klinik of the lmu münchen in the time between <URL> and <URL> <EOS>
<SOS> it could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures due to their variety hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> among the operation methods the k wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i e <EOS>
<SOS> the k wire without cerclage was used in two cases <EOS>
<SOS> twelfe fractures were treated with ao plate osteosynthesis <EOS>
<SOS> three fractures had to be treated by resection as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious ac arthrosis during the conservative therapy <EOS>
<SOS> 92 7 of the subjective results of the <NUM> checked up patients were good and very good <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical follow up of <NUM> and the radiological follow up of <NUM> patients revealed in 97 a good and very good outcome in the boenisch score <EOS>
<SOS> insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from autoimmunological processes <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a <NUM> year old female adolescent in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective long term follow up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was launched to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> from august <NUM> to december 1995 <NUM> patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> it was the first neck exploration for <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure n 67 <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative course of all patients is known <EOS>
<SOS> we carried out one to nine reexaminations median 4 in <NUM> of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up period ranged from <NUM> month to <NUM> years with a median of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> after the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in <NUM> of patients <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone <EOS>
<SOS> within the first month after surgery <NUM> of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear <EOS>
<SOS> one year after surgery <NUM> of the patients with pruritus and <NUM> of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic <EOS>
<SOS> after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase <NUM> u l experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations p <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> to date <NUM> of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal osteopathy at the time of operation <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain <EOS>
<SOS> coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> a 15 year old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type ii a was undergoing lipid aphereses therapy once or twice a week since she was <NUM> years old <EOS>
<SOS> single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease <EOS>
<SOS> using buccal mucosa operative time is substantially reduced by using a two team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture <EOS>
<SOS> excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures <EOS>
<SOS> focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed <EOS>
<SOS> for patients with long or dense strictures grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques <EOS>
<SOS> background as the slit lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in vivo examination and documentation of the multi layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea e g during wound healing processes our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope clso zeiss into a high resolution confocal laser scanning microscope clsm for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system <EOS>
<SOS> in order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy ptk as well as some in vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy prk <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> years experience with nearly <NUM> transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis tipp repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication anesthesia modification of the technique and results are reported <EOS>
<SOS> after intraoperative classification of the hernia the tipp repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall l m ii <EOS>
<SOS> the procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> during <NUM> local tipp repairs conversion of anesthesia was never necessary <EOS>
<SOS> important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh 10 cm x <NUM> cm and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each <EOS>
<SOS> apart from an increased number of seromas 12 in the early postoperative period the results of the tipp are comparable with those obtained after shouldice repair for recurrent hernia <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of hematomas infections and testicular complications range between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias the tipp repair reveals a favourably low 1 year recurrence rate of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> if representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a <EOS>
<SOS> the permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial <EOS>
<SOS> the policemen the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide whether the induction of emesis is really necessary the physician has to declare the risks <EOS>
<SOS> especially when there are only a few drug containers and the person is no professial body packer non invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs <EOS>
<SOS> rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law <EOS>
<SOS> the deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra and its tilt into kyphotic malposition <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of the two components is very different the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis <EOS>
<SOS> the kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile <EOS>
<SOS> there are two compensation mechanisms hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and if that is not sufficient verticalisation of the sacral bone performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints <EOS>
<SOS> the latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages <EOS>
<SOS> therefore correction of the kyphosis of l5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis angle delta is less than <NUM> <NUM> ° and the sacral inclination less than <NUM> <NUM> ° <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg <EOS>
<SOS> the first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination <EOS>
<SOS> it provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain x ray of the whole leg <EOS>
<SOS> in this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a p view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs <EOS>
<SOS> today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the ct scan <EOS>
<SOS> however the multitude of analytical methods for ct measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison thus it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice <EOS>
<SOS> not every ct measurement is better than a physical examination <EOS>
<SOS> evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results <EOS>
<SOS> up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the ulm ct method <EOS>
<SOS> one alternative is the mr scan which avoids radiological risks but the reproducibility and accuracy of the mri method are not as good as for the ct method <EOS>
<SOS> another alternative is ultrasound where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of mri <EOS>
<SOS> the three dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents <EOS>
<SOS> this method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults <EOS>
<SOS> purpose management of organ confined rcc is primarily surgical <EOS>
<SOS> 5 year survival rates of all stages improved from <NUM> in the 1950th to <NUM> in the 60th and stagnate at <NUM> in recent series <EOS>
<SOS> paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of rcc thus better amenable for radical operation <EOS>
<SOS> other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care <EOS>
<SOS> however it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value <EOS>
<SOS> selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis dvt who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis were included in a prospective study <EOS>
<SOS> the decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism <EOS>
<SOS> from march <NUM> to march <NUM> in <NUM> outpatients 118 men <NUM> women mean age 25 8 16 39 years a clinical examination and a colour coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of dvt of the lower limb <EOS>
<SOS> a phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected <EOS>
<SOS> two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf <EOS>
<SOS> clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed <EOS>
<SOS> these results suggest that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> for the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic which consists of standard nomenclature classification instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards <EOS>
<SOS> there are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal <EOS>
<SOS> it is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care quality management and research <EOS>
<SOS> basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the who is histologic typing of salivary gland tumours in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this tumor was first described in <NUM> by ellis and wiskovitch from the armed forces institute of pathology afip <EOS>
<SOS> basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2 9 of all salivary gland malignancies <EOS>
<SOS> more than 90 of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland <EOS>
<SOS> intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only <EOS>
<SOS> tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases <EOS>
<SOS> histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> the case presented here is a middle aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate <EOS>
<SOS> therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins <EOS>
<SOS> knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence up to 50 and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as <NUM> <NUM> years after removal of the primary tumor <EOS>
<SOS> ten year survival is around 75 <EOS>
<SOS> purpose to study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically slit lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease <EOS>
<SOS> ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries <EOS>
<SOS> this is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population <EOS>
<SOS> medical progress with application of conservative surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases but markedly increased the medical care costs <EOS>
<SOS> the result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with liver disease with portal hypertension however the risk of recurrent peracute conduit bleeding is increased <EOS>
<SOS> while the diagnosis is simple several therapeutic options are available <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3 ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel <EOS>
<SOS> the resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised <EOS>
<SOS> if bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered <EOS>
<SOS> malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source <EOS>
<SOS> objectives the cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in vitro as well as under in vivio conditions <EOS>
<SOS> a further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash out with mock csf <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury tbi has greatly expanded <EOS>
<SOS> this in turn has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage <EOS>
<SOS> the present article focuses on the pathophysiology of tbi and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention <EOS>
<SOS> while some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of tbi others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages <EOS>
<SOS> this study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> a questionnaire for self assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas the eppendorf schizophrenia inventory or esi was constructed and administered to first episode schizophrenics sche n 45 negative syndrome schizophrenics schn n 45 remitted schizophrenics schr n 24 depressives dep n 43 alcoholics alk n 48 obsessive compulsive patients zwa n 46 and healthy controls kon n 57 <EOS>
<SOS> comparisons between the sche schn dep alk and zwa groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia specific dimensions attention and speech impairment as ideas of reference ir auditory uncertainty au and deviant perception dp <EOS>
<SOS> further analyses suggested that the as syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while ir au and dp probably are reversible episode indicators <EOS>
<SOS> the results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches <EOS>
<SOS> introduction the conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca kcs can be sometimes frustrating <EOS>
<SOS> especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder even the application of artificial tears as often as every <NUM> min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface <EOS>
<SOS> a microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland sg can be performed by a maxillo facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases <EOS>
<SOS> we report <NUM> years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure <EOS>
<SOS> aims the predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the sequelae of surgical resection and high dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease <EOS>
<SOS> therefore this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> materials and methods we reviewed a total of <NUM> 18f 2 fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 18fdg pet investigations performed in <NUM> patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases re staging group a was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases pet served as a screening procedure group b <EOS>
<SOS> statistic evaluation included sensitivity specifity positive negative predictive value and accuracy of 18fdg pet for the detection of tumor manifestation <EOS>
<SOS> results 18fdg pet correctly identified <NUM> of <NUM> tumor sites 88 in the re staging group and <NUM> of <NUM> tumor sites 90 in the screening group <EOS>
<SOS> we encountered a total number of <NUM> false positive foci with an increased 18fdg uptake <EOS>
<SOS> in six patients 18fdg pet detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of these <NUM> patients the pet findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient is fate <EOS>
<SOS> specificity was 63 for local recurrence 97 for secondary lymph node involvement and 90 for distant metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion according to these data 18fdg pet is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow up of oral cancer patients to date <EOS>
<SOS> due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow up of oral cancer either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore recommend 18fdg pet for screening and re staging of recurrent oral cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in over <NUM> of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease the nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long term results <EOS>
<SOS> dysphagia inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original nissen rossetti fundoplication into the so called floppy nissen fundoplication a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus <EOS>
<SOS> failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> here reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication <EOS>
<SOS> technical alternatives may selectively be chosen when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia esophageal shortening or serious esophageal motility disorders <EOS>
<SOS> such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy barium swallow 24 h ph monitoring and manometry <EOS>
<SOS> alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs including the nissen fundoplication collis gastroplasty and the belsey mark iv <EOS>
<SOS> modifications of the <NUM> <NUM> ° nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the hill repair and the toupet dorsal fundoplication <EOS>
<SOS> because of a high failure rate in the long term follow up application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the angelchik prosthesis is not recommended <EOS>
<SOS> we report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy gan starting in a 5 year old boy with gait disturbance <EOS>
<SOS> at the age of <NUM> years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms intention tremor nystagmus and visual disturbance <EOS>
<SOS> the boy also had curly hair <EOS>
<SOS> sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments which were also found in cytoplasma of schwann cells endothelial cells and fibrocytes <EOS>
<SOS> similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemically desmin vimentin heat shock protein 70 and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons which however contained neurofilament protein 68 <NUM> and <NUM> tubulin <EOS>
<SOS> our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of gan <EOS>
<SOS> the endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> october <NUM> and <NUM> may 1995 <NUM> patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on <NUM> hands were documented in a prospective study <EOS>
<SOS> the following results were taken from a questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> there were not any complaints or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in <NUM> of <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> there were continuing complaints in four cases and after an additional check two patients were operated on again <EOS>
<SOS> the advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement <EOS>
<SOS> for surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50 60 mmhg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages <EOS>
<SOS> however blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia <EOS>
<SOS> we report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves i and ii of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials baep disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia 31 1 ° c <EOS>
<SOS> the waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from <NUM> to <NUM> mmhg <EOS>
<SOS> the oesophageal temperature had dropped by <NUM> ° c at this time <EOS>
<SOS> the 2 channel electroencephalogram eeg showed no irregularities during this time period <EOS>
<SOS> a bilateral reversible apparently blood pressure dependent loss of waves i and ii during arterial hypotension despite a normal eeg has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the isolated loss of waves i and ii with maintenance of waves ii iv and v is unusual <EOS>
<SOS> the literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave v could be recorded <EOS>
<SOS> this is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves i to iv <EOS>
<SOS> others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of baep wave i due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus <EOS>
<SOS> assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the baep waves a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves i and ii <EOS>
<SOS> another potential source could be the induced hypothermia but this does not seem very likely because the patient is temperature was <NUM> ° c lower at the return of the waves than at their loss <EOS>
<SOS> in the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> in a group of <NUM> patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ecg recordings the determinants for the development of vt and the relationship between signal averaged ecg and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis of the long term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of rr intervals 30 15 5 1min and immediately before onset of the vt the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ecg signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between <NUM> and 300hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a qrs width las of 38ms and rms40 of 16uv <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis of the long term ecg produced monomorphic vt in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only <NUM> cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats <EOS>
<SOS> a long short phenomenon could only be proven in 4vt episodes <EOS>
<SOS> in 84 of all tachycardias no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event <EOS>
<SOS> according to the circadian clock two peaks mornings between <NUM> and 9h and evenings between <NUM> and 9h could be determined <EOS>
<SOS> in patients who were recently diagnosed with arvd a significant shortening of the rr intervals before the onset of vt as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed <EOS>
<SOS> this effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of avrd <EOS>
<SOS> late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74 overall <EOS>
<SOS> increasingly late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the arvd <EOS>
<SOS> a correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias ventricular sustained or not sustained vt could not be established <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to the origin of vt in coronary heart disease previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy <EOS>
<SOS> most importantly an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of vt and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 54 year old male patient with a syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two <NUM> endoscopic debridements and lavage <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains <EOS>
<SOS> this therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump <EOS>
<SOS> we describe an eighteen months old boy who suffered from congenital vitium cordis jejunalatresia microcephaly facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic often because of bike accidents <EOS>
<SOS> if physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome muscle transfer operations are possible <EOS>
<SOS> the results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively radiological clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> thirty one patients 7 female <NUM> male underwent a trapezius transfer between march <NUM> and december <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the average age was <NUM> years range 18 46 years <EOS>
<SOS> we performed the operations using a modification of saha is technique <EOS>
<SOS> with the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus a sagital skin incision is the first step followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder acromion clavicle scapular spine <EOS>
<SOS> the deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine <EOS>
<SOS> the next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle <EOS>
<SOS> after elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally <EOS>
<SOS> then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone to bone contact <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> <NUM> ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4 5 mm screws <EOS>
<SOS> finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> the physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle <EOS>
<SOS> six weeks after the procedure we take an x ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm <EOS>
<SOS> the preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> we achieved an average increase of active abduction from <NUM> <NUM> ° range 0 45 <NUM> ° preoperatively to <NUM> <NUM> ° range <NUM> <NUM> ° 80 <NUM> ° <NUM> year after the operation the increase of forward flexion was from <NUM> <NUM> ° range <NUM> <NUM> ° 85 <NUM> ° to <NUM> <NUM> ° range <NUM> <NUM> ° 90 <NUM> ° <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder <EOS>
<SOS> finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> we analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from <NUM> arsonists <EOS>
<SOS> the following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to dsm ii r and idc 10 seem appropriate <EOS>
<SOS> first the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in dsm ii r may also have an aggressive motive <EOS>
<SOS> second icd 10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania <EOS>
<SOS> this seems untenable since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse <EOS>
<SOS> repeated firesetting resulting from being fascinated by fire etc may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism which supported by alcohol abuse extends into older age <EOS>
<SOS> the mean age of such arsonists is slightly above <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age <EOS>
<SOS> the mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below <NUM> years those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35 deluded arsonists have a mean age of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> concrete sexual motives are relatively rare <EOS>
<SOS> approximately <NUM> of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive <EOS>
<SOS> retaliation is a rare cause however since most of them do not even know the victims <EOS>
<SOS> one third of these persons set the fire in their own homes <EOS>
<SOS> most arsonists show a personality disorder with insecurity and narcissism predominating <EOS>
<SOS> data on firesetting are to be treated with caution since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved one fourth of cases concern minors and in central europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists <EOS>
<SOS> a normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses <EOS>
<SOS> an in vitro investigation was performed to eval uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> the nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine <EOS>
<SOS> all tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions <EOS>
<SOS> three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative <EOS>
<SOS> an irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a <NUM> per cent solution <EOS>
<SOS> the nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> as benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres <EOS>
<SOS> in our burn centre <NUM> patients were treated from <NUM> to june <NUM> between <NUM> and <NUM> patients per year except for <NUM> with <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> patients were evaluated according to the absi score mean 7 and had mortality of around 15 <EOS>
<SOS> the costs range between <NUM> and <NUM> million dm per year the profit lies in the same range <EOS>
<SOS> the costs are divided into staff costs 1 4 <NUM> million dm per year costs for medical treatment 1 5 <NUM> million dm per year and costs for internal services 600 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> dm per year such as laboratory examinations 247 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> dm per year and blood bank 100 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> dm per year the main factors in this category <EOS>
<SOS> the different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis <EOS>
<SOS> possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients <EOS>
<SOS> in benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied <EOS>
<SOS> this review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> after an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated spirometric measurements at rest are collected <EOS>
<SOS> among these peak expiratory flow rate pef proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways <EOS>
<SOS> a novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions this test identifies the pressure flow relationship created exclusively by the local lesion <EOS>
<SOS> in serial stenoses it indicates which is of higher clinical impact <EOS>
<SOS> patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity <EOS>
<SOS> they tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue <EOS>
<SOS> therefore spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load <EOS>
<SOS> the decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> stroke units are hospital based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes <EOS>
<SOS> following the initial neurolo gical and neuroradiological evaluation early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke <EOS>
<SOS> acute management includes monitoring of physiological parameters care by specialized nurses and early implementation of physiotherapists speech therapy and occupational therapy <EOS>
<SOS> despite the increased initial costs the long term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability <EOS>
<SOS> heparin induced thrombocytopenia hit is the most important side effect of heparin therapy <EOS>
<SOS> two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin a frequent non immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and on the other hand an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods we report on two cases with hit type ii after coronary artery bypass grafting cabg <EOS>
<SOS> hit antibodies were demonstrated by elisa for platelet factor 4 heparin complex and heparin induced platelet activation hipa assay <EOS>
<SOS> results a <NUM> year old patient suffered from a hit type ii seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization <EOS>
<SOS> in this patient a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy <EOS>
<SOS> thromboembolic complications did not occur <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old patient developed a hit type ii with thromboembolic complications <NUM> days after cabg <EOS>
<SOS> the vascular occlusions affected the a spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior syndrome the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction and the a iliaca interna <EOS>
<SOS> a white clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta in the left atrium and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion with therapy with heparin it is obligatory to check platelet count <EOS>
<SOS> an indication for the development of hit type ii is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of hit type ii recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration <EOS>
<SOS> oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury sepsis and multiple organ failure <EOS>
<SOS> injured patients patients with pulmonary diseases and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation indicating increased oxidant stress <EOS>
<SOS> n acetylcysteine nac has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments <EOS>
<SOS> nac has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine and hence glutathione and by scavenging of oxidant species 1 11 17 29 <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was designed to investigate whether the application of nac in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes <EOS>
<SOS> because nac has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied too <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1995 <NUM> patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively <NUM> patients <MOB> suffered from pain <NUM> <MOB> had a walking range below <NUM> m seven patients were unable to work in their original profession <EOS>
<SOS> after an average period of <NUM> months postoperatively the patients were examined again <EOS>
<SOS> at this time <NUM> <MOB> had no or minimal pain <NUM> <MOB> had no claudication <EOS>
<SOS> according to the score of angus and skuginna in <NUM> of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful according to kitaoka is clinical rating system for ankle hindfoot midfoot hallux and lesser toes the average postoperative score was <NUM> points <EOS>
<SOS> objective to examine changes in body mass index bmi in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity <EOS>
<SOS> the review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls <EOS>
<SOS> in a random sample of <NUM> hospital in patients aged <NUM> and over the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed <EOS>
<SOS> questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> we present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended <EOS>
<SOS> neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth <EOS>
<SOS> in atopic eczema patients the well known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels white dermographism delayed blanch after acetylcholine paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema free state in comparison with controls <EOS>
<SOS> in this follow up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema <EOS>
<SOS> severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema free cutaneous state <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 9 year old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall <EOS>
<SOS> this rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life <EOS>
<SOS> the typical clinical presentation is a solitary usually 2 6 cm large non tender mass of blue greyish colour which is mostly located on the back anterior chest wall thigh or groin <EOS>
<SOS> the histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis <EOS>
<SOS> characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo or epithelium and relatively small multinucleated cells floret cells <EOS>
<SOS> the recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins <EOS>
<SOS> it is of pre eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy <EOS>
<SOS> to correct severe septal deformities it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft <EOS>
<SOS> the utilization of a compound graft which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon pds foil facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum <EOS>
<SOS> stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females <EOS>
<SOS> the usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral <EOS>
<SOS> two competitive techniques bladder neck suspension in accordance with stamey and colposuspension in accordance with burch were retrospectively investigated <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in <NUM> and <NUM> total 76 patients respectively <EOS>
<SOS> initially both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate 91 3 and <NUM> resp <EOS>
<SOS> however the continence rate of the stamey patients deteriorated after <NUM> weeks down to <NUM> and after more than <NUM> years only <NUM> of these patients were still completely continent mean follow up <NUM> mths whereas deterioration in the burch patients was only <NUM> mean follow up <NUM> mths <EOS>
<SOS> the disappointing results with the stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence <EOS>
<SOS> it was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression <EOS>
<SOS> the three cases of recurring incontinence after burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery <EOS>
<SOS> with respect to long term follow up our results with the stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the burch technique <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in our opinion the burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence <EOS>
<SOS> this paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders an issue being neglected in german psychiatry for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> social inequality will be discussed in it is dimensions socioeconomic status and sex referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge <EOS>
<SOS> because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level <EOS>
<SOS> these concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur <EOS>
<SOS> a short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change <EOS>
<SOS> further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure and last but not least a gender sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated <EOS>
<SOS> it is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation although influences on the voice are not assumed <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the vocal fundamental frequency vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones <EOS>
<SOS> through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway resonances and antiresonances are formed and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent <EOS>
<SOS> nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> the fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture <EOS>
<SOS> when the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture <EOS>
<SOS> sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position <EOS>
<SOS> this change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture <EOS>
<SOS> in this situation increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies <EOS>
<SOS> these findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of this occurrence is still not clear <EOS>
<SOS> its consequences however should be known to the dentist ent surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures <EOS>
<SOS> cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure as a function of severity of disease <EOS>
<SOS> the source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research <EOS>
<SOS> potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself <EOS>
<SOS> we present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system particularly interleukin <NUM> release <EOS>
<SOS> objectives this <NUM> survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach <EOS>
<SOS> in addition anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the neuroanesthesia study group of the german society of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine dgai published in <NUM> were investigated and compared to results of a <NUM> survey <EOS>
<SOS> polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation <EOS>
<SOS> this helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction primarily in advanced maternal age patients <EOS>
<SOS> this might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients <EOS>
<SOS> polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant <EOS>
<SOS> however it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected <EOS>
<SOS> the paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended <EOS>
<SOS> ethical considerations do not play a role since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos <EOS>
<SOS> pachydermoperiostosis friedreich erb arnold syndrome touraine solente golé syndrome is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance it occurs almost exclusively in men <EOS>
<SOS> a report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31 year old man is presented <EOS>
<SOS> associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch crystal nails thickening of the skin and soft tissues hyperhidrosis of hands and feet hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea gynaecomastia and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty <EOS>
<SOS> radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones <EOS>
<SOS> endocrine disturbances were not detected <EOS>
<SOS> skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages <EOS>
<SOS> primary idiopathic hereditary pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary symptomatic forms of the disease which are often associated with lung tumours <EOS>
<SOS> the following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa <EOS>
<SOS> for both eating disorders psychotherapy is the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> in clinical practice treatment packages are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in bulimia nervosa cognitive behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful <EOS>
<SOS> newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa <EOS>
<SOS> recently a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended with self care manuals as the first step <EOS>
<SOS> in anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in and outpatient treatments <EOS>
<SOS> family therapy cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice however only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies <EOS>
<SOS> medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa <EOS>
<SOS> absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection turp and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy pnl into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a turp syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the measurement of end tidal breath alcohol concentration et ac as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2 ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide n2o fig <EOS>
<SOS> an electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device alcomed 3010 envitec <EOS>
<SOS> the stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model <EOS>
<SOS> in a clinical investigation the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery <EOS>
<SOS> skin diseases the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary <EOS>
<SOS> this resource may help with the diagnosis explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability <EOS>
<SOS> the different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of new possibly occupationally related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation <EOS>
<SOS> 32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the hamilton depression rating scale <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were divided into two groups according to their age <EOS>
<SOS> the result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti depressant effect of sleep deprivation <EOS>
<SOS> during mri controlled resection of brain tumors using an open mri system operation induced alterations may occur especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall <EOS>
<SOS> this may simulate tumor areas resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non tumorous areas <EOS>
<SOS> based on <NUM> mri and biopsy controlled brain tumor resections in an <NUM> t open mri signa sp ge the appearance and origin of operation induced reactions are analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation induced microcontusions <EOS>
<SOS> the beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10 15 min <EOS>
<SOS> mri controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation <EOS>
<SOS> angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium <EOS>
<SOS> the tumor is most commonly found in the skin <EOS>
<SOS> the cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation <EOS>
<SOS> background lipoprotein a is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non small cell lung cancer nsclc no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy <EOS>
<SOS> researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for nsclc including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration <EOS>
<SOS> patients were classified into the uicc 1987 stages i n 115 ii n 42 and iia n 113 <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with n1 positive lymph nodes n 61 we found higher 5 year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration 39 than for patients with hilar infiltration 21 <EOS>
<SOS> patients with n2 disease showed skip metastases in up to <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> we found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration <EOS>
<SOS> due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for nsclc <EOS>
<SOS> the muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control <EOS>
<SOS> this second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease <EOS>
<SOS> methods from february <NUM> to february 1998 <NUM> patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure abf using the transperitoneal approach <EOS>
<SOS> six <NUM> to <NUM> mm ports were needed to dissect cross clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices <EOS>
<SOS> the aortic anastomosis was made end to side <EOS>
<SOS> a long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision <EOS>
<SOS> the distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally <EOS>
<SOS> results the laparoscopic abf was performed successfully in <NUM> of <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> three times a conversion to open surgery was requested <EOS>
<SOS> one patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the icu <EOS>
<SOS> mean operative time was <NUM> <NUM> min the aorta was crossclamped for <NUM> <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells <EOS>
<SOS> in the study group blood loss averaged <NUM> <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> the bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were discharged <NUM> <NUM> days after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up after <NUM> <NUM> months <NUM> patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory <EOS>
<SOS> all grafts were patent and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> one patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible safe and effective procedure <EOS>
<SOS> specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge <EOS>
<SOS> in the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of adamantiades behçet is disease over a two year period <EOS>
<SOS> he presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx recurrent genital ulcers perianal lesions and a positive pathergy test <EOS>
<SOS> ocular involvement and other <NUM> symptoms associated with the disease were absent <EOS>
<SOS> however the early onset of the <NUM> disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections <EOS>
<SOS> an igg 3 subclass was detected <EOS>
<SOS> lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti cd3 monoclonal antibody in both patients while response to pwm coa and pha was normal <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the concentration of serum soluble interleukin <NUM> receptor was reduced in both patients <EOS>
<SOS> a polymerase chain reaction pcr assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established <EOS>
<SOS> the primers tr1 and tr2 amplify a <NUM> bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit 18s rrna of fungi <EOS>
<SOS> pcr allowed the detection of isolates of <NUM> common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds <EOS>
<SOS> hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and candida albicans <EOS>
<SOS> restriction analysis of the pcr product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds <EOS>
<SOS> the specifity of the pcr with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human dna collected from <NUM> dermis and epidermis specimens as well as dna from selected plants and animals <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate the clinical relevance of the pcr assay <NUM> routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by pcr and culture <EOS>
<SOS> pcr detected dermatophytes in <NUM> and culture in <NUM> of <NUM> specimens that were classified as positive <EOS>
<SOS> sensitivity of pcr 92 was higher than that of culture 73 <EOS>
<SOS> these results show that pcr has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes <EOS>
<SOS> starting with the recommendations of the psychiatrie enquête a current empirical stock taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units <EOS>
<SOS> 319 treatment units 289 in germany <NUM> in austria and <NUM> in switzerland were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit number of wards centrality of admission existence of large observation rooms wachsäle spezialized wards single sex wards regionalization sectorization open door wards coercive measures and intended structural changes <EOS>
<SOS> the return rate of questionnaires amounted 59 <EOS>
<SOS> the results show that the recommendations of the psychiatrie enquête are mostly realized today but not everywhere <EOS>
<SOS> across countries differences resulted in size of ward centrality of admission open door wards and coercive measures <EOS>
<SOS> treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission <EOS>
<SOS> differences between psychiatric hospitals psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were though significant smaller than expected in the light of past controversies <EOS>
<SOS> intended structural changes mainly concerned open door wards internal sectorization decentralization of admission and mixing the sexes in single sex wards <EOS>
<SOS> background the ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses pcl is withdrawn from the surgeon is view <EOS>
<SOS> using high resolution ultrasound we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the haptics <EOS>
<SOS> many patients would like to resume some sport activities after total knee replacement however most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence <EOS>
<SOS> background considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used <EOS>
<SOS> methods the present experience of the authors embraces <NUM> patients with a total of <NUM> inguinal hernias including <NUM> recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> the operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks <EOS>
<SOS> results analysis of the data concerning the first <NUM> patients with <NUM> year complete follow up reveals a mean sem operating time of <NUM> 1 2 min for unilateral and <NUM> 1 0 min for bilateral hernia repair <EOS>
<SOS> mean sem postoperative hospital stay was <NUM> 0 04 days <EOS>
<SOS> complication rates during and after operation were <NUM> and <NUM> respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the morbidity rate at <NUM> month after operation was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the recurrence rate was <NUM> at 1 year follow up <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease <EOS>
<SOS> careful follow up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate <EOS>
<SOS> background the aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age related maculopathy arm the children of the arm patients f1 generation and normals <EOS>
<SOS> in approximately 4 10 of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions <EOS>
<SOS> in the present investigation that included <NUM> patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment related intra or postoperative mortality <EOS>
<SOS> however in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long term survival of the patients following surgical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients <EOS>
<SOS> vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> in this category penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients males younger than <NUM> years of age at time of surgery maximum of two risk factors exclusion of diabetes mellitus <EOS>
<SOS> long term success decreased to <NUM> to <NUM> in comparison to first encouraging reports of <NUM> success <EOS>
<SOS> venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> long term success dropped under <NUM> leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates <EOS>
<SOS> despite this it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies <EOS>
<SOS> among numerous types of penile implants preference is nowadays mostly given to the three piece hydraulic models <EOS>
<SOS> however such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to <NUM> after <NUM> years have arisen depending on the type of implant <EOS>
<SOS> in a selected patient group vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of <NUM> 50 to <NUM> seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well established therapeutical option <EOS>
<SOS> it has been suggested that anhedonia the loss of pleasure is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol dependent patients <EOS>
<SOS> in a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies we examined pre and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol dependent patients <EOS>
<SOS> among alcoholics we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission which was associated with the relapse risk but not with anhedonia or depression <EOS>
<SOS> schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine d2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation but not anhedonia <EOS>
<SOS> primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum <EOS>
<SOS> these observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience but not with anhedonia <EOS>
<SOS> any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> it is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases n2 mean a poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within <NUM> years after the operation it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages <EOS>
<SOS> in analogy with high dose contrast enhanced ct there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in mri <EOS>
<SOS> one reason for these studies was the development of new and low osmolar contrast agents in the mr field <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the clinical problem a high dose contrast study in mri is rarely indicated 1 in metastatic disease mr imaging with high dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery 2 in patients with malignant glioma the high dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins <EOS>
<SOS> if a radical surgical approach is planned the diagnostic potential should be fully used if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned a standard dose study is enough <EOS>
<SOS> 3 in patients with ms a high dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable <EOS>
<SOS> the basic idea of the collaborative family health care is nothing new <EOS>
<SOS> it has its roots in the bio psycho social model of medicine developed by george engel in the u s a and it has a long tradition in the german psychosomatic medicine <EOS>
<SOS> at a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note that collaborative family health care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action orientation <EOS>
<SOS> the basic is a systemic view of illness and health <EOS>
<SOS> the doctor patient dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment triad composed of the therapist the patient and his family to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal i e <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment motivation of the patient the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist <EOS>
<SOS> a lot of studies support the resource saving potential of coopertive methods <EOS>
<SOS> however their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians psychotherapists and other <NUM> professionals <EOS>
<SOS> a potential has to be mobilized which affects by no means only the costs <EOS>
<SOS> the collaborative family health care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care <EOS>
<SOS> at a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity the iniitiatives of cfhc offer a possibility for physicians patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation <EOS>
<SOS> interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the german section of the cfhc <EOS>
<SOS> we evaluated the short to mid term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis s t a r with uncemented fixation <EOS>
<SOS> fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in <NUM> patients between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in <NUM> cases 62 primary osteoarthrosis in <NUM> cases 16 and systemic joint affection in <NUM> cases 22 e g rheumatoid arthritis 6 cases hemochromatosis 2 cases psoriasis arthritis 1 case lupus erythematodes 1 case and sclerodermia 1 case <EOS>
<SOS> there were two perioperative complications one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> seven revisions all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis were necessary local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement 3 cases posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion 2 cases percutaneous lengthening of the achilles tendon 1 case and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia 1 case <EOS>
<SOS> at the last follow up control <NUM> patients 62 were very satisfied <NUM> patients 29 were satisfied and <NUM> patients 9 were satisfied with reservations <EOS>
<SOS> the obtained range of motion was <NUM> <NUM> ° range <NUM> to <NUM> <NUM> ° with a maximal plantarflexion of <NUM> <NUM> ° range <NUM> to <NUM> <NUM> ° and dorsiflexion of <NUM> <NUM> ° 3 to <NUM> <NUM> ° <EOS>
<SOS> when the aofas hindfoot score was applied the <NUM> patients scored <NUM> points range <NUM> to <NUM> points <EOS>
<SOS> after settling of the implants within <NUM> weeks no migration was noted in any case and all implants were considered to be stable <EOS>
<SOS> the favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the s t a r total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component e g anteroposterior translation mediolateral translation and axial rotation <EOS>
<SOS> the success of implantation may depend on exact technique correct hindfoot alignement sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle and a solid bone stock <EOS>
<SOS> although our first results are very encouraging a longer follow up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study the influence of the status of the peri implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed <EOS>
<SOS> out of <NUM> tumor patients with <NUM> implants treated between july <NUM> and august 1996 a pool of <NUM> patients with <NUM> implants provided with dentures for at least <NUM> year was obtained <EOS>
<SOS> eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity <EOS>
<SOS> seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation 40 gy <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> out of <NUM> implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible <EOS>
<SOS> in order to assess the peri implant hard and soft tissues the hygiene index the sulcus bleeding index the gingiva index the pocket probing depth the peri implant bone resorption and the periotest were used <EOS>
<SOS> the results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients <EOS>
<SOS> tumor patients had significantly worse peri implant parameters than nontumor patients <EOS>
<SOS> the peri implant pocket probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate <EOS>
<SOS> the overall success rate was 77 8 <EOS>
<SOS> many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques <EOS>
<SOS> this project was set up to develop practical effective safe and easy to run acute pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> a 26 year old man sustained a c2 arc fracture <EOS>
<SOS> ventral spondylodesis using an h plate was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for <NUM> year <EOS>
<SOS> spontaneous fusion of c3 c4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred <EOS>
<SOS> the fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed <EOS>
<SOS> no further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomy of the cervical spine special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> an interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder <EOS>
<SOS> the localisation of the plexus with electro stimulation and the injection of bupivacain 0 5 were accomplished easily and without painful sensations <EOS>
<SOS> 48 hours later the block was still partially present <EOS>
<SOS> paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles <EOS>
<SOS> the deficit did not completely disappear for <NUM> month <EOS>
<SOS> the cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation toxic action of the injected substance bupivacain 0 5 <NUM> ml distension of the plexus a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis although a definite determination is not possible <EOS>
<SOS> however the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty <EOS>
<SOS> microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map like fashion <EOS>
<SOS> the localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem as one can scan the film <EOS>
<SOS> comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day light <EOS>
<SOS> magnification up to <NUM> times is possible <EOS>
<SOS> detection of early changes of the naevi during the horizontal growth phase should increase the 5 year survival rate <EOS>

<SOS> aggressive angiomyxoma aam is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> the entity was first described in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the tumor is regarded as low grade sarcoma by some authors its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown <EOS>
<SOS> this is a case report on a 27 year old man who underwent <NUM> surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm initially august 1993 diagnosed as a myxolipoma <EOS>
<SOS> the patient suffered from recurrences in february 1995 september <NUM> and february <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> a palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in february 1998 followed by a radiation therapy with <NUM> gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os <EOS>
<SOS> the single radiation doses were <NUM> cgy <NUM> times a week <EOS>
<SOS> the small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable <EOS>
<SOS> a follow up <NUM> years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> this is to our knowledge the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma <EOS>
<SOS> radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent aam for an unknown time <EOS>
<SOS> it remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect <EOS>
<SOS> micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications <EOS>
<SOS> surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized <EOS>
<SOS> with microneurosurgery of motor nerves satisfying or good results can be generally obtained <EOS>
<SOS> success rates exceeding 50 following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient <EOS>
<SOS> perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts e g by development of minimally invasive eventually endoscopically guided procedures <EOS>
<SOS> allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied <EOS>
<SOS> initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging <EOS>
<SOS> a better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration <EOS>
<SOS> objective the acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> to determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia <EOS>
<SOS> methods the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the american college of rheumatology criteria <EOS>
<SOS> urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from <NUM> patients and <NUM> age and sex matched controls <EOS>
<SOS> pyridinoline pyd and deoxypyridinoline dpyd which represent products of lysyl oxidase mediated cross linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation respectively were analyzed by ion paired and gradient hplc method with fluorescence detection hplc <EOS>
<SOS> levels of hydroxypyroline hyp a collagen turnover marker were also measured <EOS>
<SOS> the findings were related to creatinine levels and the pyd dpyd ratio determined <EOS>
<SOS> the pyd dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion decreased levels of collagen cross linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or preferably by hplc analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia <EOS>
<SOS> background the dynamic radionuclide nephrography tc99m mag3 is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi ureteric junction <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout <MOB> in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non operative managment <EOS>
<SOS> the lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies <EOS>
<SOS> there is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position we compared a new closed loop controlled ventilation algorithm adaptive lung ventilation alv which adapts the breathing pattern automatically to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation cmv <EOS>
<SOS> the aims of our study were 1 to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange 2 to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller with traditional settings of cmv and 3 to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the alv controller <EOS>
<SOS> the respirator used was a modified amadeus ventilator which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer <EOS>
<SOS> in a first set of measurements we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and <NUM> min after changing to the nephrectomy position <EOS>
<SOS> in a second set of measurements patients were ventilated with alv and cmv using a randomized crossover design <EOS>
<SOS> the cmv settings were a tidal volume of <NUM> ml kg body weight a respiratory rate of <NUM> breaths min an i e ratio of 1 1 5 and an end inspiratory pause of 30 of inspiratory time <EOS>
<SOS> with both ventilation modes fio2 was set to <NUM> and peep to <NUM> cm h2o <EOS>
<SOS> during alv a desired alveolar ventilation of <NUM> ml kg kg min was preset <EOS>
<SOS> all other ventilatory parameters were determined by the alv controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters <EOS>
<SOS> positioning induced a reduction of compliance from <NUM> to <NUM> ml cm h2o the respiratory time constant shortened from <NUM> to <NUM> s whereas physiological dead space increased from <NUM> to <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> on average the ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller resembled very closely those used with cmv <EOS>
<SOS> however an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with alv <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease <EOS>
<SOS> the novel alv controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of cmv are <EOS>
<SOS> noma is an ulcerative necrotizing gingivo stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface including lips and cheek maxilla mandible nose and rarely the orbit <EOS>
<SOS> the defects are usually unilateral <EOS>
<SOS> children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected <EOS>
<SOS> medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time <EOS>
<SOS> predisposing factors include malnourishment immunosuppression and poor oral hygiene <EOS>
<SOS> forty eight noma patients were surgically treated in sokoto nigeria during october <NUM> by an interplast germany team sponsored by awd stiftung kinderhilfe <EOS>

<SOS> during a period of <NUM> years four controled clinical studies in <NUM> patients with hypercholesterolaemia and <NUM> healthy persons in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation were performed to find out the effects of serial sun like uv irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions <EOS>
<SOS> the following significant effects were observed <EOS>
<SOS> patients with hypercholesterolaemia increase of hdl cholesterol after termination of the serial uv irradiation increase of serum <NUM> oh d3 levels decrease of serum triiodothyronine decrease of serum lactate healthy persons decrease of resting pulse rate decrease of recovery pulse rate decrease of systolic blood pressure <EOS>

<SOS> in <NUM> minor et al <EOS>
<SOS> described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula the superior canal dehiscence syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> this syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure <EOS>
<SOS> it is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior anterior semicircular canal <EOS>
<SOS> due to this dehiscence a third mobile window in addition to the round and oval windows is formed and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability <EOS>
<SOS> we compared <NUM> conservatively treated and <NUM> surgically treated patients with acl deficient knee joints with a control group of <NUM> subjects <EOS>
<SOS> the balance test was performed with a kistler force plate <EOS>
<SOS> both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group <EOS>
<SOS> this was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg <EOS>
<SOS> the differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during <NUM> s additionally the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups <EOS>
<SOS> we were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer lachman pivot shift and kt 100 measurements <EOS>
<SOS> the study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain damaged subjects <EOS>
<SOS> 116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent <NUM> extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on road driving test <EOS>
<SOS> only 58 of the patients passed the driving test <EOS>
<SOS> attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut off procedures based on neuropsychological and or other subject related data yielded a maximum of 73 correct predictions <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results it is recommended that in each case an on road driving test is given <EOS>
<SOS> in the planning of laser surgery for ent operations the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems <EOS>
<SOS> intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser resistant endotracheal tubes <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ent related laser surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study <NUM> patients were included and the mallampati score modified by samsoon and young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation <EOS>
<SOS> the results showed a significant correlation p 0 05 chi square test <EOS>
<SOS> however the specificity was only 72 and the sensitivity of 60 was too low to be of practical use <EOS>
<SOS> the results were independent of the endotracheal tube used <EOS>
<SOS> although use of the laser for ent operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use <EOS>
<SOS> this problem is demonstrated in a literature <NUM> review <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a <NUM> year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to nhl bfm <NUM> block aa protocol <EOS>
<SOS> during his therapy he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4 5 8 and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the amplatz thrombectomy device <EOS>
<SOS> the postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion dopplersonography <NUM> months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein <EOS>
<SOS> within this chapter tumors which produce bone matrix osteoid or other bone forming tissues like cartilage connective tissue and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described <EOS>
<SOS> in addition those lesions are mentioned which according to the who are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the <NUM> who classification of odontogenic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described <EOS>
<SOS> all the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance <EOS>
<SOS> a precise diagnosis therefore can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to clinical radiological and histological appearances therapeutic necessities are described <EOS>
<SOS> the data from recent publications are taken into account <EOS>
<SOS> this presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the german austrian swiss study group of tumors of the face and jaws dösak in basel <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases <EOS>
<SOS> out of this pool <NUM> completely documented cases were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> forty five patients 18 of this population were <NUM> years or older at time of admission <EOS>
<SOS> in this population <NUM> major resections and <NUM> minor liver resections were performed <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration <EOS>

<SOS> mortality after liver resection was <NUM> morbidity <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 year survival rate kaplan meier of the r0 resected patients n 21 was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease <EOS>
<SOS> survival morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences <EOS>
<SOS> these results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical course of <NUM> patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> eight patients recovered under conservative therapy one patient died due to pre existing concomitant cardiopulmonary disease <EOS>
<SOS> in three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure <EOS>
<SOS> on admission the transplanted patients had a decreased quick is test score and factor v value <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the peak of liver enzymes serum bilirubin serum creatinine partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value <EOS>
<SOS> main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial quick is test score and factor v value both <NUM> and their inadequate response under substitution therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> during submaximal isotonic back extension loading 31 male persons surface emg was measured using <NUM> monopolar linked electrodes in the low back region l 3 s 1 <EOS>
<SOS> by means of modification of amplitude and frequency parameters in the emg signal two subject groups 6 persons each with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined <EOS>
<SOS> for the analysis of muscle coordination the emg signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared <EOS>
<SOS> during the extension phase the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to this the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function <EOS>
<SOS> background a fractional flow reserve ffrmyo 0 75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function <EOS>
<SOS> we used the ffrmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the lad for decision to ptca and checked the indication by clinical follow up <EOS>
<SOS> distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> usually a non continuous distraction mode is applied <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder <EOS>
<SOS> using a submandibular approach the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini pigs corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws <EOS>
<SOS> the hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system <EOS>
<SOS> following <NUM> days at rest a continuous distraction of <NUM> mm per day was performed for <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> and <NUM> weeks postoperatively the animals were killed and x rays taken <EOS>
<SOS> the mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle <EOS>
<SOS> the continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles <EOS>
<SOS> bony regeneration seems to be accelerated which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase <EOS>
<SOS> the duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients <EOS>
<SOS> when tetracaine is used the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration <EOS>

<SOS> results the average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml and during bimaxillary surgery <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> men lost about <NUM> ml more than women <EOS>
<SOS> operations of more than <NUM> h in length led to a blood loss of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml as opposed to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> the average blood loss among various surgeons was between <NUM> ml and <NUM> ml of various anesthesiologists between <NUM> ml and <NUM> ml without statistical evidence <EOS>
<SOS> some 17 9 of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin 34 7 had pathological activities of coagulation factors but only 2 1 with clinical significance <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion mode of operation maxillary or bimaxillary und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery <EOS>
<SOS> maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14 2 of autologous blood unit <EOS>
<SOS> this should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs <EOS>

<SOS> classical insight therapy derived from freud and `maternal holding therapy derived from balint winnicott and others are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> the authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings <EOS>
<SOS> the position of freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience <EOS>
<SOS> the contra position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience <EOS>

<SOS> the measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age cognitive level psychological status intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child is individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation <EOS>
<SOS> from its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional material and morphological changes that are perceptible <EOS>
<SOS> these changes permit classifying an individual as young adult old active or infirm <EOS>
<SOS> but this estimation is not always correct <EOS>
<SOS> some appear younger some older than expected from their chronological age <EOS>
<SOS> but what is ageing and how can it be measured <EOS>
<SOS> for this so called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms <EOS>
<SOS> a description of the complexity the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi factorial measuring system in a so called test battery <EOS>

<SOS> the development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> to analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin 1 il 1 transforming growth factor alpha tgf epidermal growth factor egf epidermal growth factor receptor egf r the proliferation marker mib 1 c myc proto oncogene product and activation marker 4f2 <EOS>
<SOS> results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells <EOS>
<SOS> middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for tgf alpha egf r il 1 and c myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix <EOS>
<SOS> the local release of cytokines and growth factors such as tgf alpha egf and il 1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> the role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter <EOS>
<SOS> this paper reports the results of the austrian ultrasound hip screening program in which all austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12 16 weeks <EOS>

<SOS> the rate of open reduction went down to <NUM> per <NUM> newborns including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip <EOS>
<SOS> hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia <EOS>
<SOS> the optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only high risk hips clinical instability positive family history breech delivery should undergo hip sonography but at an age between <NUM> and <NUM> weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature <EOS>
<SOS> since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening a further reduction of costs could be accomplished <EOS>
<SOS> disability owing to ddh can be avoided in a number of cases and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized <EOS>
<SOS> transactional analysis berne 1958 in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes <EOS>

<SOS> in europe saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> from the pathogenetic point of view it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence amounts to 0 4 among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases <EOS>
<SOS> concerning this review the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all <NUM> patients we operated on between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of patients 77 are male <EOS>
<SOS> there is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand <EOS>
<SOS> a higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture in the building trade and in paper mills <EOS>
<SOS> pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47 of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> usually the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x ray especially if hemoptysis is present <EOS>
<SOS> major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma <EOS>
<SOS> clinical presentation and chest x ray findings are non characteristic <EOS>
<SOS> nowadays the typical x ray of pulmonary aspergilloma almost always localized in the upper lobes became a rare finding <EOS>
<SOS> if an aspergillus infection is suspected serologic methods are reliable and sensitive <EOS>
<SOS> a surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination <EOS>
<SOS> if a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings clinical examination and patient is social history an operation is justified <EOS>
<SOS> relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins <EOS>
<SOS> the lobectomy if necessary carried out as pleuro lobectomy is the adequate resection in most patients 68 <EOS>

<SOS> peri and postoperative complications occur in 60 of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma <EOS>
<SOS> a higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections like segmentectomies or wedge resections as compared to lobectomies <EOS>
<SOS> persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem <EOS>
<SOS> it requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients <EOS>

<SOS> introduction postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course <EOS>
<SOS> these patients recovery takes longer <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development <EOS>
<SOS> methods patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included <EOS>
<SOS> their medical history the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed the medication and laboratory data were monitored <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperatively the drugs infusions possible transfusions blood gases and pressures were monitored as were the times of surgery and anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to dsm iv criteria and mild moderate and severe delirium were distinguished <EOS>
<SOS> results fifty four patients entered the study <EOS>

<SOS> patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non aortic procedures 55 5 vs <NUM> n <NUM> each <EOS>
<SOS> some preexisting diseases hearing disturbance increased the probability of postoperative delirium while age was not identified as a risk factor <EOS>
<SOS> general psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium <EOS>
<SOS> patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently <EOS>
<SOS> this was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium <EOS>
<SOS> more reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume intra or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values hb <NUM> g dl and the development of acidosis that had to be treated <EOS>
<SOS> patients with delirium had serious complications more often 8 21 <NUM> vs 6 33 <NUM> and needed intensive care treatment longer 2 7 vs <NUM> days only aortic surgery <NUM> vs <NUM> days <EOS>

<SOS> normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than <NUM> ° from true vertical <EOS>
<SOS> after vestibular neurectomy the svv was consistently tilted by some <NUM> ° toward the affected ear <EOS>
<SOS> smaller tilts 7 ° of the svv occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases <EOS>
<SOS> this shift in svv disappeared within weeks to months similar to the spontaneous nystagmus <EOS>
<SOS> after stapes surgery slight deviations of the svv towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20 of the patients indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs <EOS>
<SOS> assessed in an upright position the svv thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears <EOS>

<SOS> the unfavourable long term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions <EOS>
<SOS> empirical findings on the etiology pathogenesis and pathophysiology are still very limited <EOS>
<SOS> actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences <EOS>
<SOS> the behavioral medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis stress inoculation cognitive redefinition problem solving reduction of pain symptoms relaxation distraction imagination and environmental modification parental reinforcement and modeling behavior <EOS>

<SOS> suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines <EOS>
<SOS> ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high dose suramin <EOS>
<SOS> four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within <NUM> <NUM> weeks of starting therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> in tumour therapy high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of <NUM> <NUM> µg ml <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes <EOS>
<SOS> acetylcholinesterase ace inhibitor induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema <EOS>
<SOS> between january 1 <NUM> and february 1 <NUM> we treated <NUM> patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> the most common reason was an ace inhibitor induced angioedema and occurred in <NUM> cases all of whom required inpatient treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the medical management consisted of the administra tion of intravenous i v <EOS>
<SOS> glucocorticosteroids in all cases h1 blockers in <NUM> cases epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i v <EOS>
<SOS> tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient <EOS>
<SOS> in our experience it is necessary to reconsider ace inhibitor induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema <EOS>
<SOS> however there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases <EOS>
<SOS> after treatment of more than <NUM> kidney and ureteral stones with the siemens lithostar multiline the results of the first <NUM> ureteral stone treatments using the booster technique and 3 month follow up findings are reported <EOS>
<SOS> there was a disintegration rate of <NUM> directly after treatment <NUM> week after booster technique treatment <NUM> of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms <EOS>

<SOS> only in <NUM> of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary <NUM> of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy eswl and <NUM> after eswl <EOS>
<SOS> 43 of the treatments were performed without any premedication anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia <EOS>
<SOS> our data even prove that in situ eswl is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to endoscopic procedures it is superior in regard to invasivity side effects complications and neccessity of analgesia while being just as efficient <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones <EOS>
<SOS> the perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss snhl <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of patients with snhl suffer from a cochlea amplifier ca failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions oae <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the ca <EOS>
<SOS> thus the implant is thought to function as a cai cochlea amplifier implant <EOS>
<SOS> an approved implant for routine use is not yet available <EOS>
<SOS> clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming hec narrow band electromagnetic floating mass transducer as well as the maniglia hec implant <EOS>

<SOS> even <NUM> years after the first description of the syndrome jme is an underdiagnosed illness <EOS>
<SOS> the generally <NUM> positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification <EOS>
<SOS> background the aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag fixated iol implantation in children <EOS>
<SOS> arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease <EOS>
<SOS> previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> during follow up a progression of these alterations has been reported <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication <EOS>
<SOS> vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin <EOS>
<SOS> first the basic circulation parameters should be determined <EOS>
<SOS> blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential <EOS>
<SOS> depending on these findings further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken <EOS>
<SOS> if the situation is stable diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> a general examination including a vaginal and rectal examination must be performed <EOS>
<SOS> other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound vaginal and transabdominal and ct or mri may be required <EOS>
<SOS> if available an angiography should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> medium term results with a follow up of at least <NUM> years were done in <NUM> patients average follow up <NUM> months after acl reconstruction using ikdc evaluation form and noyes score and in <NUM> patients average follow up <NUM> months after non operative management <EOS>
<SOS> unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with acl reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the best functional results we found in professional athletes after acl reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx <EOS>
<SOS> 15 of the patients from the natural history group who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients <EOS>
<SOS> it will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability <EOS>
<SOS> we have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the acl deficient knee <EOS>
<SOS> based on our results we primarily limitate the acl reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high risk pivoting sports <EOS>
<SOS> only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes <EOS>
<SOS> multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged <NUM> years or more <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score iss of at least <NUM> points were divided in two age groups y <NUM> <NUM> years n 1022 o <NUM> <NUM> years n <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases 69 while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers 41 <EOS>
<SOS> iss was comparable in both groups y <NUM> 1 o <NUM> 1 <EOS>
<SOS> during icu therapy incidence of ards y 10 o 11 multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mof y 6 o 9 and pneumonia y 17 o 21 were comparable <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast septic complications were more frequent in older patients y 19 o 27 <EOS>
<SOS> length of icu stay y <NUM> 2 o <NUM> 1 and ventilation time y <NUM> 2 o <NUM> 1 were comparable <EOS>
<SOS> mortality was significantly higher in older patients y 15 o 53 <EOS>
<SOS> the major cause of death was sepsis in older patients y 15 o 31 and mof in younger patients y 54 o 29 <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications <EOS>
<SOS> the raynaud phenomenon occurs in <MOB> of patients with systemic scleroderma <EOS>
<SOS> it is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences <EOS>
<SOS> early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances <EOS>
<SOS> structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm <EOS>
<SOS> new vasodilatory treatment strategies e g <EOS>
<SOS> infusions with calcitonin gene related peptides could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma <EOS>
<SOS> due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence strong efforts were made to find non pharmacological strategies <EOS>
<SOS> for three years now the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix from incontrol has been available as an alternative therapy <EOS>
<SOS> from october <NUM> to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in <NUM> patients worldwide <EOS>
<SOS> the sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90 the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100 <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> patients <NUM> episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with <NUM> shocks per episode <EOS>
<SOS> no proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen <EOS>
<SOS> a cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95 of patients the overall clinical success rate was 88 <EOS>
<SOS> in 7 of all patients early recurrence of atrial fibrillation eraf occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in 4 1 there were lead related complications in <NUM> patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy and in <NUM> patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients postoperative complications were seen infections pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein <EOS>
<SOS> overall the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> background the success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established <EOS>
<SOS> the somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults <EOS>
<SOS> these differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest <EOS>
<SOS> maturation of a and c fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat <EOS>
<SOS> in early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non nociceptive system <EOS>
<SOS> in preterms but not in adults non noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization <EOS>
<SOS> many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period <EOS>
<SOS> more important receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile <EOS>
<SOS> the descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system <EOS>
<SOS> thus during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable <EOS>
<SOS> for example neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later <EOS>
<SOS> numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public is attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced <EOS>
<SOS> since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community based psychiatric care we must ask how public opinion might be influenced <EOS>
<SOS> one possible approach could be through so called key community leaders those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area <EOS>
<SOS> doctors belong to this group of people <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason we questioned medical students as future key community leaders with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies <EOS>
<SOS> in order to make a direct comparison possible we interviewed a sample of the mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill in fact in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has <EOS>
<SOS> we were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes <EOS>
<SOS> systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor is drainage basin <EOS>
<SOS> this requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes <EOS>
<SOS> systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging <EOS>
<SOS> an intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging <EOS>
<SOS> recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure related complications <EOS>
<SOS> life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often as a result of tumour infiltration postoperative anatomical changes infection and radiological necrosis difficult to control <EOS>
<SOS> one option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external eca or common carotid artery cca and superior thyroid artery sta <EOS>
<SOS> 52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the external carotid artery eca was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases closure of the eca cca or eca and sta was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment operation primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> there was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the eca <EOS>
<SOS> one patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction <NUM> year after operation <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> patients and in all <NUM> patients in whom ligature of the cca or eca and sta respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured <EOS>
<SOS> the number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the eca performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the eca than observed after ligating the cca or eca and sta in an emergency situation <EOS>
<SOS> the carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity <EOS>
<SOS> typical however is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> as the tumor is very rare there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a review of the literature was performed <EOS>
<SOS> we report about a 28 year old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity <EOS>
<SOS> without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases <NUM> months after surgical resection <EOS>
<SOS> as treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow up on a regular basis <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative precision in computer assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system the precision of correlation between object and data set the position number and fixation of landmarks and the parameters of the data set <EOS>
<SOS> the characteristics of a navigation system in particular the immanent precision can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the university of regensburg with the support of carl zeiss germany <EOS>
<SOS> the precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured viewing wand isg mechanical system the smn microscope carl zeiss infrared system with laser autofocus the mkm system carl zeiss robot platform with laser autofocus and the stp pointer leibinger infrared system <EOS>
<SOS> the immanent precision of these systems ranges from <NUM> to <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> an electromagnetic system 3 space digitizer polhemus was compared this produces serious spherical deviations of <NUM> to <NUM> mm in the presence of metal surgical and rotating instruments and circuits <EOS>
<SOS> the application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp among hiv infected children 18 years in germany <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis course of disease and prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes <EOS>
<SOS> glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition <EOS>
<SOS> these agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels in particular they reduce the osteoblast is synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix <EOS>
<SOS> they also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations particularly in men and postmenopausal women <EOS>
<SOS> gastrointestinal stromal tumors gist which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract have not yet been fully investigated <EOS>
<SOS> although good progress has been made in their diagnosis classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1998 <NUM> gist patients underwere operation in the department of surgery <EOS>
<SOS> twelve of these patients 67 had stromal tumors in the stomach and six 33 had intestinal stromal tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the primary tumor could be removed in all patients with r0 resection <EOS>
<SOS> six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis with the size of their primary tumor exceeding <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case <EOS>
<SOS> lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur <EOS>
<SOS> histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of lewin weinstein and riddell <EOS>
<SOS> currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases <EOS>
<SOS> adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed <EOS>
<SOS> acute leptospirosis in europe weil is disease is a rare and in more than <NUM> of the cases undiagnosed febrile self limited disease <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 39 year old sewerage worker who was admitted to our hospital with fever jaundice pain in his calves and acute renal failure <EOS>
<SOS> serology revealed elevated antibody titers against leptospira canicola l icterhaemorrhagica and l sejroe <EOS>
<SOS> the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation dic with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia <EOS>
<SOS> the ecg showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac arrest developed most likely due to hypoxia with a drop in the blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue <EOS>
<SOS> a medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given the disease being recognized as an occupational disease <EOS>
<SOS> during the past decade the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression including metastasis and angiogenesis have become better understood <EOS>
<SOS> cancer metastasis consists of multiple complex interacting steps <EOS>
<SOS> each of these steps is crucial and limiting since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood and lymph vessels <EOS>
<SOS> the intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels <EOS>
<SOS> adhesion to endothelial cells extravasation from the circulation and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation it will survive only by evasion of the immune system <EOS>
<SOS> the systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches <EOS>
<SOS> hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible <EOS>
<SOS> to date transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male <EOS>
<SOS> future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate <EOS>
<SOS> any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate <EOS>
<SOS> pigmented villonodular synovitis pvns is a disease that involves the lining of joints bursae and tendon sheaths <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence is low and estimated to be <NUM> patients per million population <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of pvns is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic <EOS>
<SOS> pvns has been described in <NUM> forms different for prognosis and treatment nodular and diffuse <EOS>
<SOS> the articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a <NUM> year old patient <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study <NUM> patients with subtle lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of <NUM> months using clinical assessment radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention <EOS>
<SOS> all patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity increased motion in the subtalar joint increased load on the hindfoot decreased load on the forefoot and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase <EOS>
<SOS> radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial lisfranc joint <EOS>
<SOS> an unstable medial lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot <EOS>
<SOS> initial treatment of a subtly displaced lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> after failed initial treatment early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot <EOS>
<SOS> cross sectional imaging with ct and mri plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms <EOS>
<SOS> adequate interpretation of the ct and mr images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment <EOS>
<SOS> both ct and mr imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre epiglottic space paraglottic space subglottic region and cartilage <EOS>
<SOS> the high negative predictive value of both ct and mri allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably <EOS>
<SOS> the specificity of both ct and mri is however limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless both cross sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> in the presence of a submucosal mass ct and mri play a key role for the diagnosis as they may characterize the lesion reliably depict its submucosal extent and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> background hla dr antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology <EOS>
<SOS> organ culture storage leads to loss of hla dr positive corneal langerhans cells <EOS>
<SOS> this study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty <EOS>
<SOS> ergotamine containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks <EOS>
<SOS> among others spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a <NUM> year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine attacks since adolescence <EOS>
<SOS> due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers <EOS>
<SOS> after withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely <EOS>
<SOS> the spectrum of ergotamine induced side effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in this article a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians <EOS>
<SOS> this model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help <EOS>
<SOS> the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance has three elements 1 <EOS>
<SOS> a qa inventory for routine monitoring 2 <EOS>
<SOS> rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and 3 <EOS>
<SOS> a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists quality circles <EOS>
<SOS> the focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results <EOS>
<SOS> it is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> this feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients <EOS>
<SOS> the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of quality assurance which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service <EOS>
<SOS> aims in this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia bier block was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics <EOS>
<SOS> a pre term infant weighing <NUM> g gestational age <NUM> weeks developed an acute abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left silasticcatheter and right 24 g cannula saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> during surgical exploration a perforation of the terminal ileum was found <EOS>
<SOS> the operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end to end anastomosis and a double lumen colostomy <EOS>
<SOS> major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems <EOS>
<SOS> despite transfusion of erythrocyte 100 ml thrombocytes 75 ml and albumin 50 ml the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension <EOS>
<SOS> administration of atropine adrenaline and calcium iv had no effect <EOS>
<SOS> the operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> when the drapes were removed livid swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava <EOS>
<SOS> after insertion of a <NUM> g iv cannula into a vein of the right upper arm the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of <NUM> ml blood and <NUM> ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful <EOS>
<SOS> paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava <EOS>
<SOS> if venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre termintanty a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre operative venesection <EOS>
<SOS> while complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness <EOS>
<SOS> in our study we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of formica rufa d6 and reinjection of the patient is own blood is superior to injection of placebo <EOS>
<SOS> 104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective randomized double blind study <EOS>
<SOS> during four weeks they received twice weekly either <NUM> ml of formica rufa d6 in combination with <NUM> ml of blood or <NUM> ml nacl intramuscular <EOS>
<SOS> before and after therapy mobility thoracic excursion and doctor is overall assessment were measured in addition to patient is health status using a german version of the arthritis impact measurement scales before and after therapy as well as four twelve and twentyfour weeks later <EOS>
<SOS> we were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the therapy under study may not be regarded effective <EOS>
<SOS> a 32 year old man was accused of attempted rape <EOS>
<SOS> while urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection <EOS>
<SOS> he approached a 9 year old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation <EOS>
<SOS> shortly afterwards he was arrested <EOS>
<SOS> he confessed but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence which he normally would never have thought of <EOS>
<SOS> shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation <EOS>
<SOS> three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later a pathogenetic connection in terms of a preceding warning leak might be assumed <EOS>
<SOS> we present a 43 year old patient who has had up to <NUM> frontal lobe seizures nightly for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness <EOS>
<SOS> neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal <EOS>
<SOS> after sleep deprivation an interictal electro encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area <EOS>
<SOS> a cerebral pet study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region <EOS>
<SOS> the sleep structure was extremely fragmented <EOS>
<SOS> there was an excessive reduction of slow wave sleep and rem sleep <EOS>
<SOS> carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks followed by return of up to <NUM> seizures per night <EOS>
<SOS> vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to <NUM> to <NUM> per night <EOS>
<SOS> introduction we attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in vlbw infants for practical use in a tertiary care center <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> we report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin induced thrombocytopenia hit after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin dependent antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed preventing an imminent compartment syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> another <NUM> days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face as well as severe headache <EOS>
<SOS> his platelet count increased from <NUM> 00 µl to <NUM> 00 µl <EOS>
<SOS> after exclusion of other causes for these symptoms a reaction to heparin dependent antibodies heparin platelet factor <NUM> complex was demonstrated <NUM> days later <EOS>
<SOS> thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin refludan and elevation of thrombocytes to <NUM> 00 µl was noted <EOS>
<SOS> shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than <NUM> ie unfractionated heparin at day <NUM> after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock which could be managed with cortisone <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest that in hit the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte <EOS>
<SOS> this is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application even though the symptoms may vary <EOS>
<SOS> as thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin induced antibody reaction in our hospital only <NUM> of <NUM> patients with hit the disease should rather be named heparin allergy <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types i iv <EOS>
<SOS> the new types i and ii are similar to hit types i and ii <EOS>
<SOS> type ii is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes and type iv the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations <EOS>
<SOS> the patients involved were a boy with pierre robin syndrome a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in goldenhar is syndrome a case with nager is syndrome and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome <NUM> 18p syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the distraction period lasted from <NUM> to <NUM> days and new bone formation ranging from <NUM> to <NUM> mm was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip knee and ankle joint <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity and mortality after reversal of hartmann is procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low <EOS>
<SOS> aim to investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of hartmann is procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient <EOS>
<SOS> method nineteen patients were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative course was followed prospectively <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were reinvestigated <NUM> months after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> results laparoscopic reversal of hartmann is procedure was attempted in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> one patient did not want the laparoscopic technique <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases 11 conversion to the conventional technique was necessary thus <NUM> patients were operated laparoscopically <EOS>
<SOS> median operative time was <NUM> <MOB> min <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed <EOS>
<SOS> patients convalescence was fast <EOS>
<SOS> first evacuation took place <NUM> 3 5 days after surgery complete oral nutrition <NUM> 3 5 days after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> duration of postoperative hospitalisation was <NUM> 5 12 days <EOS>
<SOS> one patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion laparoscopically assisted hartmann is reversal is technically demanding but feasible <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative morbidity is low duration of hospitalisation short convalescence fast <EOS>
<SOS> thus good arguments exist for performing reversal of hartmann is procedures laparoscopically <EOS>
<SOS> mechanical ventilation is a well etablished strategy in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> icu trauma patients require analgesia and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time <EOS>
<SOS> the weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome showing tachycardia hypertonia tachypnea and restlessness <EOS>
<SOS> although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> adding sufentanil an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency <EOS>
<SOS> in this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both the patient and physician <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with a group of <NUM> patients treated with clonidine alone <NUM> patients treated with clonidine sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation 4 8 vs <NUM> days and until discharge from the icu 7 7 vs <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> background with regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues microsurgical techniques hla typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> this now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed <EOS>
<SOS> however in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in <NUM> in hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved <EOS>
<SOS> however this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat <EOS>
<SOS> as a result the who presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic <EOS>
<SOS> strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the who suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans <EOS>
<SOS> given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy <EOS>
<SOS> many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered <EOS>
<SOS> so far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents ha1a e5 anti tnf antibodies ilra have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit <EOS>
<SOS> in certain trials results were indecisive or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies <EOS>
<SOS> in certain other trials like those on antibodies against tnf some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients <EOS>
<SOS> thus new trials are on their ways <EOS>
<SOS> so far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re examine the concept of immunomodulation and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host while not putting him at risk <EOS>
<SOS> recently percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy pdt has become more frequent since the technique can be mastered relatively easily <EOS>
<SOS> pdt is neither time consuming nor does it require much personell or material <EOS>
<SOS> our study seeks to evaluate pdt in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio surgical icu <EOS>
<SOS> recently two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics sevoflurane and desflurane have been approved for clinical use in germany <EOS>
<SOS> their low solubility in blood is the most important common property and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used <EOS>
<SOS> extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted <EOS>
<SOS> both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> for sevoflurane there are additional advantages a pleasant odor negligible airway irritation and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane <EOS>
<SOS> a certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane 2 5 to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound a in carbon dioxide absorbents <EOS>
<SOS> the extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects <EOS>
<SOS> new insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound a may well support clinical experience <EOS>
<SOS> desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless potential side effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of co from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects <EOS>
<SOS> thus desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia especially in children <EOS>
<SOS> the tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity especially at concentrations above <NUM> mac limits its application in patients with cardiac disease <EOS>
<SOS> the doctor in charge who is generally the medical director is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department <EOS>
<SOS> even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible that is to say the medical director to be liable <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training <EOS>
<SOS> every training measure must guarantee specialist standards this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist <EOS>
<SOS> a legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times <EOS>
<SOS> operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization <EOS>
<SOS> because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners often doctors doing their practical training are on call very early on <EOS>
<SOS> in the high risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times <EOS>
<SOS> the changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed <EOS>
<SOS> there must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed <EOS>
<SOS> each sector must know its own area of responsibility <EOS>
<SOS> the doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment <EOS>
<SOS> uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects <EOS>
<SOS> georg friedrich stromeyer <MOB> 1876 is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in germany knows him because of the stromeyer hook which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures <EOS>
<SOS> this special aspect as well as stromeyer is biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine <EOS>
<SOS> changes in clinical presentation of crohn is disease cd patients age at the time of disease manifestation and operation general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study <EOS>
<SOS> 395 operations for cd were divided into consecutive groups and analysed <EOS>
<SOS> in an increasing number of cases patients presented with the fibrostenotic type rather than the fistulizing type of complaints <EOS>
<SOS> the duration of disease and of medical management increased <EOS>
<SOS> patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition <EOS>
<SOS> we found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent cd or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons <EOS>
<SOS> primary surgery for cd increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut in the case of recurrence of multiple minimal resections <EOS>
<SOS> the average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> the complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery <EOS>
<SOS> even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity <EOS>
<SOS> etiologically numerous factors must be taken into account the most significant one being arteriosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous <EOS>
<SOS> ct and above all intra arterial dsa allow for a diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> a generous consideration of indicating operative intervention even in asymptomatic patients is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture <EOS>
<SOS> the preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization <EOS>
<SOS> in the future a treatment with coated stents tpeg would also seem possible <EOS>
<SOS> special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> background clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase 4 argininosuccinate synthetase 2 and argininosuccinate lyase 2 are described <EOS>
<SOS> methods therapy emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i v as well as peritoneal dialysis and or modified hemodialysis <EOS>
<SOS> chronic treatment comprised a low protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched chain amino acids <EOS>
<SOS> results within <NUM> hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed leading to developmental retardation later in life <EOS>
<SOS> four patients died between <NUM> weeks and <NUM> years of age <EOS>
<SOS> during follow up all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively <EOS>
<SOS> phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side effects than benzoate branched chain amino acids had favourable effects <EOS>
<SOS> one patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder <EOS>
<SOS> specific therapy as described can be life saving although most children exhibit marked developmental delay <EOS>
<SOS> sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side effects than sodium benzoate <EOS>
<SOS> therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications <EOS>
<SOS> pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation <EOS>
<SOS> large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the defects extend from the cranial to the central ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this <EOS>
<SOS> the anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances <EOS>
<SOS> the new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access the patient is general status and osseous regenerationability <EOS>
<SOS> in the optimum case osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method <EOS>
<SOS> if this is not possible special implants mostly custom made prostheses have to be incorporated <EOS>
<SOS> however the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with progressive muscular dystrophy pmd invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was a long term follow up of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> twelve consecutive patients 9m 3f age <NUM> <NUM> yrs without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study <EOS>
<SOS> they suffered from different stages of pmd type erb n 4 becker kiener n 4 duchenne n 2 and landouzy déjerine n 2 <EOS>
<SOS> at the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study eps <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up of <NUM> yrs included regular clinical visits ecgs and holter recordings every <NUM> months as well as an echocardiography every <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the eps revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance ahrs acs <NUM> 18ms and in <NUM> pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found hv max <EOS>
<SOS> conduction defects were seen independently from the type of pmd and the stage of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> during the follow up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ecg in <NUM> of <NUM> pts <EOS>
<SOS> one of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> five of <NUM> pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an av block grade i ii and in one case additionally a bundle branch block <EOS>
<SOS> four of these pts whose pmd showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy needed pacemaker implantation because of a first degree av block bifascicular bundle branch block n 1 a mobitz ii second degree av block n 1 or a third degree av block n 2 <EOS>
<SOS> none of the pts with normal findings at the eps showed abnormal p waves an av block or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow up <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances especially infrahisian defects including high degree av blocks are a common finding in pts with pmd <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ecg and a holter recording is reasonable in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below <NUM> °c and is caused by exposure to cold drugs endocrine dysfunction central nervous system disorders skin disorders and trauma <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the degree of hypothermia there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations <EOS>
<SOS> bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast prostate and lung <EOS>
<SOS> the decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology presence and extent of extraskeletal disease and the performance status of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> for patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer or prostate cancer hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases chemotherapy should be initiated <EOS>
<SOS> all patients with small cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes <EOS>
<SOS> in non small cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition <EOS>
<SOS> radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult <EOS>
<SOS> new approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful <EOS>
<SOS> although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences <EOS>
<SOS> a condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions <EOS>
<SOS> it must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment <EOS>
<SOS> current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma <EOS>
<SOS> prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation <EOS>
<SOS> maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the main associated risks are pre term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes <EOS>
<SOS> to reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed <EOS>
<SOS> these developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future <EOS>
<SOS> methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world <EOS>
<SOS> in germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to mrsa has occurred during the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with mrsa <EOS>
<SOS> this report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of mrsa and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of mrsa in hospitals and nursing homes <EOS>
<SOS> during general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques <EOS>
<SOS> gas climatisation however markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at and corresponding water condensation within the hoses factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of this prospective study was to investigate <NUM> how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> 2 to investigate whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases <EOS>
<SOS> introduction undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver the incidence of which is highest in children between <NUM> and <NUM> years of age 14 1 <EOS>
<SOS> among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia <EOS>
<SOS> embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults <EOS>
<SOS> to our knowledge only <NUM> cases have been published in the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> methods and results we now present the case of a 29 year old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion this case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver <EOS>
<SOS> the management of this case comprised primary tamponade interventional embolisation of the feeding artery and secondary resection under stable conditions <EOS>
<SOS> substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> however reasons are discussed why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients <EOS>
<SOS> insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency structural problems expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves <EOS>
<SOS> though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand <EOS>
<SOS> readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented <EOS>
<SOS> they are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude <EOS>
<SOS> they can be easily implemented in different settings <EOS>
<SOS> at the end of the first part of this review in patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined <EOS>
<SOS> this will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches <EOS>
<SOS> the following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability <EOS>
<SOS> a model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis <EOS>
<SOS> the concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive <EOS>
<SOS> four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis kwo our preferred method of treatment of unstable colles fracture <EOS>
<SOS> biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of kwo <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application <EOS>
<SOS> the pain in the lower limbs growing pain represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour <EOS>
<SOS> the delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> in psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the talking cure because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common <EOS>
<SOS> often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat <EOS>
<SOS> the symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then <EOS>
<SOS> gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of body language suggests <EOS>
<SOS> instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms on i e <EOS>
<SOS> if there is saphenous vein agreement between them phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation <EOS>
<SOS> the prospective comparative examination of non invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12 of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3 for the small with a correction of the operative procedure <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases of incomplete trunk varicosis only one diagnosis was correct with non invasive measures <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability <EOS>
<SOS> in this aspect the classification based on anderson and d alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> in this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended <EOS>
<SOS> in a period of <NUM> years between march <NUM> and march 1998 <NUM> patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery <EOS>
<SOS> according to manometric studies <NUM> patients had a short floppy nissen fundoplication patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication toupet 42 dor thal 25 <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6 3 after mean 16 7 months follow up nissen <NUM> toupet <NUM> dor thal <NUM> p 0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in <NUM> nissen <NUM> toupet <NUM> dor thal <NUM> n s <EOS>
<SOS> the assessment of visick is score at the latest control showed the following visick i <NUM> visick ii <NUM> visick ii <NUM> visick iv <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the outcome of the operation was rated excellent or good by <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to auditory brainstem potentials abr a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials mlr can be assumed due to the longer integration time present <EOS>
<SOS> to date the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on mlr has not been completely known <EOS>
<SOS> by using masking with high pass filtered white noise in <NUM> normal hearing adults we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of abr and mlr on filter frequency <EOS>
<SOS> no differences were found between the masking effects for abr and mlr evoked by tone bursts of <NUM> and <NUM> khz <EOS>
<SOS> the high pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the abr than on mlr <EOS>
<SOS> these different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials <EOS>
<SOS> our findings show that mlr evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds especially in low frequency ranges <EOS>
<SOS> objectives to clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation htx <EOS>
<SOS> background some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long term success of the operation <EOS>
<SOS> incidence underlying risk factors etiologies and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined <EOS>
<SOS> methods retrospective analysis of our cohort of <NUM> cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142htx patients of the years <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> clinical events death mode of death re htx resuscitation were noted and analyzed by the kaplan meier method and related to the patients characteristics by multivariate analysis <EOS>
<SOS> sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death <EOS>
<SOS> clinical and postmortem findings autopsies are available in 12 18 sudden death patients were correlated to the mode of death <EOS>
<SOS> results during a mean follow up interval of <NUM> <NUM> years <NUM> patients died 38 <EOS>
<SOS> the mode of death was non sudden in <NUM> inpatients <EOS>
<SOS> 18 deaths were sudden <NUM> of these out of hospital <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations one of those patients died three month later suddenly giving a number of a total of <NUM> cardiac arrests in 20htx patients <EOS>
<SOS> the actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20 after <NUM> and 40 after <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in <NUM> patients rejection in <NUM> patients international society for heart and lung transplantation grade 3a and to unknown reasons in one <EOS>
<SOS> all three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events 2xtotal av block 1xsinus arrest <EOS>
<SOS> pacemakers were implanted in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> one of those died suddenly <NUM> months later <EOS>
<SOS> significantly more htx patients dying suddenly are smokers had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction and worse hemodynamics <EOS>
<SOS> qrs width and pr interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest <EOS>
<SOS> in three cases a decrease in heart rate variability the occurence of sustained vt and st segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after htx <EOS>
<SOS> as htx patient numbers are rising constantly sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem <EOS>
<SOS> in our patients about 75 of the arrests can be attributed to graft vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk <EOS>
<SOS> interestingly some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> introduction traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee <EOS>
<SOS> the indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial <EOS>
<SOS> methods and results from <NUM> to 1994 <NUM> patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department <EOS>
<SOS> thirty four of these patients were followed up for 3 16 years mean <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases of the follow up group reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed <EOS>
<SOS> in the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone <EOS>
<SOS> at the time of follow up <NUM> of the patients showed good knee stability but <NUM> had lack of motion as well <EOS>
<SOS> post traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate <EOS>
<SOS> thirty five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the lysholm score <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions positive prognostic factors were an age less than <NUM> years at the time of the accident a low energy trauma e g a sports related injury early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments and initial postoperative functional treatment <EOS>
<SOS> huntington is disease hd is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a cag triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different <EOS>
<SOS> the development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so called intranuclear inclusion bodies <EOS>
<SOS> this new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies on transgenic hd mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of hd which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> transgenic animal models of hd will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches <EOS>
<SOS> background the whipple operation pd is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region <EOS>
<SOS> however the pylorus preserving duodenopancreatectomy ppd is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function <EOS>
<SOS> methods in a prospective randomized trial october 1994 october 1998 pd and ppd were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life operation time duration of hospital stay transfusions and perioperative morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions eortc qlq 30 pre and postoperatively weeks 2 6 12 24 36 48 and 60 <EOS>
<SOS> results a duodenopancreatectomy was performed in <NUM> patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas n 38 and the periampullary region n 10 pd n 24 ppd n 24 <EOS>
<SOS> the pd and ppd groups did not differ according to age gender or uicc stage <EOS>
<SOS> operation time was shorter in the ppd group 206 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> min p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity did not differ between the two groups ppd <NUM> vs pd <NUM> p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> while there was no difference in global quality of life gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the ppd group regarding appetite nausea and diarrhea p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> while the preoperative body weight was reached after <NUM> months in <NUM> of the ppd group n 20 this was true in only <NUM> of the pd group n 14 p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion ppd seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than pd <EOS>
<SOS> oxygen uptake v o2 and carbon dioxide elimination v co2 can be measured with an indirect calorimeter this method is well established in routine monitoring of icu patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress <EOS>
<SOS> in various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole body metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately <EOS>
<SOS> abdominal aortic cross clamping changes circulation nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus v o2 and v co2 <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore used this operation for our study <EOS>
<SOS> for certain indications anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation <EOS>
<SOS> the surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> however an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose the pig is a highly suitable model <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman <EOS>
<SOS> in the animal model a change in position organ preparation from the cranial direction a suprasymphysial approach to the vertebrae has proved expedient <EOS>
<SOS> operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures created from the tomographic data of a patient <EOS>
<SOS> computer assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field <EOS>
<SOS> the desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma dscc of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the dscc has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion maximum <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> this type accounts for 8 2 n 44 of our collective of <NUM> squamous cell carcinomas scc of the skin and vermilion border <EOS>
<SOS> clinically dscc look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin <EOS>
<SOS> all tumors were followed up for at least <NUM> years maximum <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the local recurrence rate was high 24 3 even though micrographic surgery was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high 22 7 <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91 8 scc is n 550 was low 2 6 and 3 8 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the dscc seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic scc the fine stranded scc or the scc with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well but dscc is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group <EOS>
<SOS> the dscc is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently <EOS>
<SOS> in the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness <EOS>
<SOS> the interaction between the patient with als and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support <EOS>
<SOS> the patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of als depending on the individual disease process <EOS>
<SOS> already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled <EOS>
<SOS> if als patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term <EOS>
<SOS> background the advent of multidetector ct mdct constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging <EOS>
<SOS> however while the basic principles of spiral ct still apply we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a ct study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of mdct <EOS>
<SOS> extracorporeal photophoresis ecp a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years is based on separation of a leucocyte lymphocyte enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8 mop uva and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient <EOS>
<SOS> its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated modulated cells <EOS>
<SOS> the immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment <EOS>
<SOS> ecp is normally performed for <NUM> h per day on <NUM> consecutive days every <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects <EOS>
<SOS> in our department <NUM> ecp treatments were administered to <NUM> patients between <NUM> and <NUM> and a preliminary evaluation was performed <EOS>
<SOS> these patients included <NUM> with cutaneous t cell lymphoma ctcl <NUM> with progressive systemic scleroderma <NUM> with chronic graft versus host disease and <NUM> each with pemphigus vulgaris epidermolysis bullosa acquisita lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis <EOS>
<SOS> patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with ctcl <EOS>
<SOS> a treatment combining ecp with rlfn puva and or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour stage ctcl and lymph node involvement <EOS>
<SOS> progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50 of our cases <EOS>
<SOS> treatment results were impressive in <NUM> patients with chronic graft versus host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes <EOS>
<SOS> a clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema arndt gottron syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the effectiveness of ecp seems to be quite well established in ctcl but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses <EOS>
<SOS> ecp is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary <EOS>
<SOS> opportunistic infections after long term treatment with azathioprine aza have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis mg <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 56 year old woman with generalized mg who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with aza for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for immunosuppressive treatment in mg should be regularly reconfirmed particularly since at least 50 of patients can discontinue aza after two to four years without risk of exacerbation <EOS>
<SOS> failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem <EOS>
<SOS> although ultrasonography has <NUM> sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis <EOS>
<SOS> during laparoscopic cholecystectomy the gallbladder could not be detected <EOS>
<SOS> after laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> this method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration <EOS>
<SOS> right colon diverticulitis representing 1 3 6 of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain <EOS>
<SOS> its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis <EOS>
<SOS> patients are between <NUM> and <NUM> years old have a history of 2 3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease whereas perforations abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection <EOS>

<SOS> presentation geographic variations diagnostic procedures and management are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi <EOS>
<SOS> uv exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> these changes are associated with an increased expression of hmb 45 antigen <EOS>
<SOS> in addition an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after uv exposure <EOS>
<SOS> the increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression <EOS>
<SOS> the uv light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> therefore both keratinocyte derived factors and direct influence of uv on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes <EOS>
<SOS> while these exogenously evoked changes are reversible the potential biologic relevance especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade reguires clarification <EOS>

<SOS> the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease <EOS>
<SOS> core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium sized pre collapsed lesions <EOS>
<SOS> for these types of lesions osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success <EOS>
<SOS> for small or medium lesions that are post collapse various bone grafting procedures have been used <EOS>
<SOS> this approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large <EOS>
<SOS> limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement <EOS>
<SOS> if there is acetabular involvement total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> guillain barré syndrome gbs is an acute inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system <EOS>
<SOS> clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with gbs <EOS>

<SOS> the immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s <EOS>
<SOS> despite numerous publications in this field it has not been possible to standardize the method and <NUM> establish the ideal antibody either nationally or internationally <EOS>
<SOS> molecular biological methods using pcr technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum <EOS>
<SOS> however one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease specific marker gene <EOS>
<SOS> as a result immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection <EOS>

<SOS> for several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected <EOS>
<SOS> however during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly <EOS>
<SOS> to validate this impression we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of <NUM> trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident <EOS>
<SOS> it was found that 39 4 of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21 2 required some correction 39 4 were placed correctly <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases 6 1 life threatening complications developed because of the chest tube necessitating a thoracotomy in <NUM> patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other <EOS>
<SOS> based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident <EOS>
<SOS> based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy <EOS>

<SOS> screening data were available for <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the reduction in mortality found in randomized studies due to mammography in women over <NUM> years old was confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> a relative reduction of 44 8 in 10 year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25 1 through palpation in comparison with doing nothing <EOS>
<SOS> we could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the munich region <EOS>
<SOS> if the mammographies carried out today were used at 2 year intervals for women aged between <NUM> and <NUM> years then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70 of the women <EOS>
<SOS> the known facts regarding the population based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in germany are and what they should fulfill <EOS>
<SOS> insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament acl reconstruction is a typical complication <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> january <NUM> and <NUM> december <NUM> a total of <NUM> operations at the acl were performed in the traumatology department of nuremberg hospital <EOS>

<SOS> hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal <EOS>
<SOS> among these tumors ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a 26 year old female patient who presented with left sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus <EOS>
<SOS> t2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion <EOS>
<SOS> bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high resolution computed tomography <EOS>
<SOS> a hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach <EOS>
<SOS> histologically new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma <EOS>
<SOS> in general radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma <EOS>
<SOS> based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma <EOS>
<SOS> however reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> recovery may be delayed stunning or persistent if perfusion remains reduced hibernation and ischemia may go on to necrosis thus contributing to chronic heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> in addition myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation which may result in chronic left heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> this process is characterized by hemodynamic neurohumoral and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated <EOS>
<SOS> hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction and in most cases years after myocardial infarction in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure <EOS>
<SOS> neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin and in an activation of the renin angiotensin system <EOS>
<SOS> plasma endothelin 1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure and prognosis was related to endothelin levels <EOS>
<SOS> diminished response of vessels to endothelium edrf no dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart e g systemic activation to hemodynamic changes <EOS>
<SOS> structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> molecular control of these processes which include various cell types such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered <EOS>

<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to compare health related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients were included 20 treated by endovascular and <NUM> by conventional surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a questionnaire with <NUM> items similar to the sf 36 was answered during scheduled appointments <EOS>
<SOS> on the third postoperative day the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed 80 vs 32 and complained of intervention related pain 90 vs 42 and incisional pain 26 vs 15 55 of the patients suffered from obstipation vs 5 of the endovascular group <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified <EOS>
<SOS> in comparable percentage both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively <EOS>
<SOS> sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group 33 vs 13 three months postoperative <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities 25 vs 40 and had more fear of ambulation 35 vs 6 <EOS>
<SOS> the patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations 39 vs 5 that were often related to x ray exposure 67 vs 20 <EOS>
<SOS> all of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement vs 89 of the endovascular group nevertheless only 28 felt completely healthy compared to 11 of the endovascular treated patients <EOS>
<SOS> advantages of the endovascular treated patients were short hospital stay decreased pain smaller scars and a shorter confinement to bed <EOS>
<SOS> after intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality of life aspects <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities <EOS>
<SOS> the patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent x ray examinations than the conventionally treated group <EOS>
<SOS> in the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period <EOS>
<SOS> however about 20 of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are e g left heart failure inadequate sedation neuropsychiatric issues malnutrition and aspiration <EOS>
<SOS> the mere application of a consistent weaning strategy independent from its concrete content leads to an improved success rate <EOS>
<SOS> in this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with 1 the concept of interventions in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles 2 pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3 organisation of the t tube trials <EOS>
<SOS> a new approach in weaning of long term ventilated patients is non invasive mechanical ventilation nmv <EOS>
<SOS> compared to invasive mechanical ventilation nmv aims at reducing weaning time decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis <EOS>

<SOS> the temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path <EOS>
<SOS> on the opposite in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished <EOS>
<SOS> symmetrical madness prevails matte blanco <EOS>
<SOS> the temporal core of the analytic situation is bi logical <EOS>
<SOS> this ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles <EOS>
<SOS> free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path again and again <EOS>
<SOS> there are however different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability <EOS>

<SOS> several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine <EOS>
<SOS> indeed family studies segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of extragenetic factors however remains mostly unknown <EOS>
<SOS> recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity <EOS>
<SOS> a locus for familial hemiplegic migraine fhm the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal dominant transmission has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown i e different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus <EOS>
<SOS> further investigations should concentrate on identifying the fhm gene on chromosome 19p13 on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees <EOS>
<SOS> this would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and thus to therapeutic developments <EOS>
<SOS> radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders <EOS>
<SOS> as bone mass is lost changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur <EOS>
<SOS> the changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease <EOS>
<SOS> even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique <EOS>
<SOS> with radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass <EOS>

<SOS> small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors but rather to the patients attitude of neglect <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a 62 year old patient featuring such attitude demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor <EOS>

<SOS> while the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents <EOS>
<SOS> the results of <NUM> single stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> no complete flap loss occurred in any case <EOS>
<SOS> the results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically <EOS>
<SOS> due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged <EOS>
<SOS> pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks <EOS>
<SOS> psychotherapists have the alternative to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves or otherwise leave this important task to external instances <EOS>
<SOS> those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept <EOS>
<SOS> this paper discusses the question how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved <EOS>
<SOS> differentiation is necessary between the use of the psy bado for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality and psychotherapy research <EOS>
<SOS> this paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> cicatrical pemphigoid cp comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes lesions characteristically heal with scarring <EOS>
<SOS> immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the igg and less frequently of the iga class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone <EOS>
<SOS> these autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of cp <EOS>
<SOS> most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen <NUM> bpag2 collagen type xvii with a molecularweight of <NUM> kd <EOS>
<SOS> a smaller group of patients with cp have autoantibodies to laminin <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules bpag2 and laminin 5 are important in blister formation <EOS>
<SOS> there are other autoantigens described in cp however they are only found in small groups of cp patients and most of them are not further characterised <EOS>
<SOS> the described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex <EOS>
<SOS> impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture <EOS>
<SOS> study objective the clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the nmda receptor <EOS>
<SOS> due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen we expected an analgesic preemptive effect <EOS>
<SOS> this study was carried out following the breivik stubhaug preemptive effect study design <EOS>
<SOS> dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis facial clefts and encephaloceles <EOS>
<SOS> this article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> using this operation technique the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of <NUM> mm to <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> however the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits <EOS>
<SOS> the intercanthal distance decreased from an average of <NUM> mm to <NUM> mm whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> a strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in <NUM> patients postoperatively only in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate <EOS>
<SOS> four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a t4 carcinoma <NUM> years after adjuvant radiation and <NUM> months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema destruction of the infected dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens <EOS>
<SOS> successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty heller and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of prosthetic infections is between <NUM> and 2 5 and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> after lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in intrathoracic infectious complications extra anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered <EOS>
<SOS> if there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology <EOS>
<SOS> for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi standardized and reproducible criteria are required <EOS>
<SOS> in case of the diagnosis of melanoma the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the deutsche dermatologische gesellschaft <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies have shown that acute infections especially of the respiratory tract are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> however the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we performed a case control study using a standardized questionaire and examination <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia stroke and <NUM> age and sex matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group <EOS>
<SOS> dental status was determined by a so called total dental index tdi which reflects primarily caries periodontitis periapical lesions devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index pi <EOS>
<SOS> specifically older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects <EOS>
<SOS> a predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion poor dental health mainly resulting from chronic dental infections may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> the results must now be verified in larger studies <EOS>
<SOS> as chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine <EOS>
<SOS> adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role <NUM> in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> it involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture <EOS>
<SOS> emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect <EOS>
<SOS> glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay <NUM> of anti inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti inflammatory effects <EOS>
<SOS> antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully <NUM> during periods of exacerbation <EOS>
<SOS> systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of bacterial triggered eczema the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful <EOS>
<SOS> the present paper presents data obtained over a <NUM> year period on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some <NUM> arthritic and <NUM> non arthritic n human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method <EOS>
<SOS> when the relative metabolic synthetic repair activity of these human cartilages was compared it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis oa and rheumatoid arthritis ra cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50 as compared with n cartilages <EOS>
<SOS> however the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between non arthritic and oa but was very substantially increased in ra cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus <EOS>
<SOS> the action of <NUM> nsaids was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage gag synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> 3 of these nsaids were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> consideration of the results in this study and from published material led to the suggestion that nsaids may be divided into <NUM> categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> those such as aceclofenac tenidap and tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> those such as piroxicam tiaprofenic acid and aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> those like naproxen ibuprofen indomethacin nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> it is suggested that the stimulatory action of group <NUM> nsaid is due to inhibition of locally produced il1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity <EOS>
<SOS> other nsaids may also inhibit il1 synthesis or release but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> these experiments led to the suggestion that nsaids such as aceclofenac would be appropriate for long term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo <EOS>
<SOS> the article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre operative anxiety and its impact on the post operative course development <EOS>
<SOS> then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment lasted <NUM> hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery <EOS>
<SOS> one and a half years later a follow up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist <EOS>
<SOS> the interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> physiologically angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role for example in wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process in which specific angiogenic factors as well as growth factors extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved <EOS>
<SOS> tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis inhibiting factors <EOS>
<SOS> some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor acidic basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor <EOS>
<SOS> the most important angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin and thrombospondin <EOS>
<SOS> to date the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors <EOS>
<SOS> for most urological tumors the grade of tumor vessel formation measured as microvessel density has been associated with metastases tumor growth and clinical course <EOS>
<SOS> the prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors <EOS>
<SOS> systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology <EOS>
<SOS> introduction cpr is an essential part of resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> german medical students must take part in at least two low level basic life support courses one for a driver is license and one for admission to medical school <EOS>
<SOS> the knowledge and skill of german medical students in cpr performance were studied <EOS>
<SOS> psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented <EOS>
<SOS> indeed since its beginning it was characterised by the two sided orientation towards disorder and resources <EOS>
<SOS> contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference lay the ground for better integrating both aspects <EOS>
<SOS> this development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique and especially to interpretation <EOS>
<SOS> more than before contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes <EOS>
<SOS> during the last few decades traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number and traffic accidents have also increased <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the speed direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact different patterns of injury occur <EOS>
<SOS> basically they are classified as hip dislocations dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures <EOS>
<SOS> these injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions <EOS>
<SOS> several classification systems have been developed for these injuries <EOS>
<SOS> commonly stewart and milford is or levin is classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures <EOS>
<SOS> for acetabular fractures judet and letournel is classification and its newer version developed by helfet ao classification are generally accepted <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the femoral head though included in these classifications are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in <NUM> by pipkin <EOS>
<SOS> the multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches <EOS>
<SOS> no single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion <EOS>
<SOS> approaches are either considered limited kocher langenbeck ilioinguinal iliofemoral when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint or extended extended iliofemoral maryland ruedi when they allow all around visualization of the hip joint <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age preexisting disease and concomitant injuries <EOS>
<SOS> the decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than <NUM> weeks after trauma <EOS>
<SOS> extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications <EOS>
<SOS> after a phase in which extended procedures were favored recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate <EOS>
<SOS> this is facilitated by modern fracture reduction methods using indirect techniques <EOS>
<SOS> a relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases using a combined metabolic electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio coronary venous difference for lactate pyruvate free fatty acids and amino acids <EOS>
<SOS> there are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old female with parry romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back <EOS>
<SOS> the disease process was limited to the c3 to t2 dermatomes on the right side <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to t10 als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm <EOS>
<SOS> sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia no progression was seen over several months using nmr to monitor the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the parry romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways in view of this unusual case we review the literature attempting to provide a more accurate case definition <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1996 <NUM> children mean age <NUM> years with hip pain were examined consecutively <EOS>
<SOS> in group i n 100 mean age <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 2 2 transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed group ii n 29 mean age <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 2 1 showed the following diagnoses perthes disease n 12 early slipped capital femoral epiphysis n 5 meyer is dysplasia n 2 septic arthritis of the hip n 2 osteomyelitis of the acetabulum n 1 abscess of the psoas n 1 chondromatosis of the hip joint n 1 ewing is sarcoma of the os pubis n 1 hip dysplasia n 1 <EOS>
<SOS> three patients who had synovitis developed perthes disease and were assigned to group ii <EOS>
<SOS> the efficiency of ultrasound scintigraphy and mri as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip <EOS>
<SOS> a capsular distension was present in <NUM> cases and showed a significant statistical difference t test p 0 001 in group i between affected and unaffected hips <EOS>
<SOS> there were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group i between the affected and the non affected side t test p 0 91 p 0 57 and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow up t test p 0 053 p 0 75 <EOS>
<SOS> mri was performed because of persistent joint effusion in <NUM> cases in group i and perthes disease was excluded <EOS>
<SOS> in group ii the use of an mri allowed the diagnosis in <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> sonographic examination together with x ray examination and serological testing represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow up of transient synovitis <EOS>
<SOS> mri should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination and when the x ray does not allow a clear diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> a 36 year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one vessel coronary artery disease 75 proximal left main coronary artery for cabg and repair of the vsd <EOS>
<SOS> after induction a transesophageal echocardiographic tee baseline examination was performed showing a severely dilated coronary sinus cs measuring approximately <NUM> cm abnormal 1 cm <EOS>
<SOS> we suggested a persistent left superior vena cava plsvc draining into the cs <EOS>
<SOS> plsvc is a common venous congenital anomaly with a reported incidence of 0 5 in general population and in 3 5 of patients with congenital heart defect <EOS>
<SOS> injection of echo contrast solution in a left arm vein visualizing microbubbles passing through the plsvc into the cs confirmed our suspicion <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of a plsvc and dilated cs is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the plsvc resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection <EOS>
<SOS> it may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter pac through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias <EOS>
<SOS> a chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the pac along the left heart <EOS>
<SOS> teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features <EOS>
<SOS> the most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition data transfer data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units <EOS>
<SOS> a selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared <EOS>
<SOS> craniopharyngiomas are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors <EOS>
<SOS> complications after surgical treatment are common <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances vision field defects deteriorated acuity cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain <EOS>
<SOS> a case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of craniopharyngioma is reported <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm <EOS>
<SOS> no damage of anatomical structure could be detected <EOS>
<SOS> seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent <NUM> visual impressions for the first time <EOS>
<SOS> over the following weeks his visus improved to <NUM> 0 5 while the chiasm edema disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> electron beam computed tomography ebct allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> this has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> ebct is therefore well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions <EOS>
<SOS> we report an unusual complication in a 53 year old woman following ileostomy for crohn is disease <NUM> years previously <EOS>

<SOS> the brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones <EOS>
<SOS> estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems <EOS>
<SOS> initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia particularly alzheimer is disease <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore estrogens may improve verbal fluency memory and mood in elderly women <EOS>
<SOS> still the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression <EOS>
<SOS> a 38 year old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma 10x12 cm in the left pectoral area <EOS>
<SOS> hyperaemia of the skin in the area of the lilac ring morphoea was quantified by means of laser doppler flux ldf <EOS>
<SOS> at the lilac border of the morphoea ldf was increased to 420 of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side <EOS>
<SOS> immediately after <NUM> days of antibiotic therapy 3x10 mega penicillin g per day i v <EOS>
<SOS> ldf normalized though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage <EOS>
<SOS> by <NUM> months later ldf was still in the normal range and clinical signs such as induration and hyperaemic redness had also significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> ldf measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged <EOS>
<SOS> it is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a cobb angle of between <NUM> <NUM> ° and <NUM> <NUM> ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected <EOS>
<SOS> the total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers <EOS>
<SOS> the medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic oral epidermal intramuscular as well as the local intracavernosal intraurethral application of pharma cological agents <EOS>
<SOS> up to now only yohimbine a well known alpha receptor blocking agent and sildenafil a newly introduced phosphodiesterase v inhibitor with predominant peripheral action have been approved and listed in germany <EOS>
<SOS> other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine central action as well as phentolamine peripheral action <EOS>
<SOS> for the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options <EOS>
<SOS> for the local application of pharmacological agents intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application medicated urethral system for erection muse are available <EOS>
<SOS> currently several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation <EOS>
<SOS> the ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and tailored therapy for each individual patient <EOS>
<SOS> while the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients it will certainly be augmented by devices i e vacuum erection devices functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum femcc and surgical treatment options vascular and prosthetic surgery <EOS>

<SOS> 10x6 cm on the right breast in a 48 year old woman with photodynamic terapy pdt <EOS>
<SOS> fractionated pdt was performed by topical application of aminolevulinic acid ala 20 with subsequent red light <MOB> nm <NUM> j cm2 in three sessions <EOS>
<SOS> nearly total remission of the tumor resulted however a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis pdd <EOS>
<SOS> these fluorescent areas were marked excised and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap <EOS>
<SOS> total excision of the tumor was verified histologically <EOS>
<SOS> by combining pdt and surgery this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results <EOS>

<SOS> 156 out of <NUM> patients 82 5 noticed changes in the lesion over the time <EOS>
<SOS> growth discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found <EOS>
<SOS> bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness 1 5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage <EOS>
<SOS> almost <NUM> months passed until half of the patients visited a physician either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations <EOS>
<SOS> in the second period of the survey from <NUM> to <NUM> the physician was frequently consulted earlier <EOS>
<SOS> the main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> out of <NUM> patients 38 1 visited the physician on their own initiative <EOS>
<SOS> the primary evaluation of the pigmental lesion was done by a primary care physician in 57 by a dermatologist in 32 and by others in 11 of our cases <EOS>
<SOS> a diagnosis of a non melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27 of the primary care physicians and 22 7 of the surgeons gynecologists or internists <EOS>
<SOS> only 5 of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions <EOS>
<SOS> in the second trial period from <NUM> to <NUM> in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in heathcare services in the context of privatisation in our health care system in east germany <EOS>
<SOS> whereas 83 2 of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first <NUM> months after consultation the proportion for those diagnosed by non dermatologists was only 58 5 <EOS>

<SOS> six patients terminated the study prematurely <EOS>
<SOS> one patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine four were excluded because of protocol violations <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> responders in the tramadol <NUM> in the tramadol and <NUM> in the racemate group 16 p0 05 in the morphine group and <NUM> in the placebo group <EOS>
<SOS> pain intensity after <NUM> min was reduced by <NUM> p0 05 <NUM> p0 05 <NUM> p0 05 <NUM> p0 01 vs placebo p0 05 vs tramadol and racemate group and <NUM> mm on the vas in the tramadol morphine and placebo group respectively <EOS>
<SOS> thirty eight adverse events like nausea vomiting pco2 increase and urinary retention occurred in <NUM> patients most frequently in the tramadol and morphine group <EOS>
<SOS> sedation was significantly less profound in the tramadol group 1 4 h postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> there were no side effect in the tramadol racemate group <EOS>
<SOS> the enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency but inferior by far to morphine <EOS>
<SOS> they showed more adverse events and hence can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> a 36 year old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography <EOS>
<SOS> because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis <EOS>
<SOS> since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before a secondary oxalosis was supposed <EOS>
<SOS> the subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade <NUM> years before during the patient is army time as a marine soldier <EOS>
<SOS> such fuels contain ethylene glycol glysantin as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria <EOS>
<SOS> the presented case however suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure <EOS>
<SOS> undergoing chronic hemodialysis the patient died <NUM> months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> at autopsy progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> insulinomas are rare tumors and account for <NUM> of all endocrine pancreatic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> they typically present as a solitary tumor but may occur in multiple sites e g <EOS>
<SOS> multiple endocrine neoplasia type i or as a malignant disease in <NUM> of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis <EOS>
<SOS> neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis inadequate high insulin and c peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation <EOS>
<SOS> the standard operation is enucleation or depending on size and location resection <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic <EOS>
<SOS> subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection <EOS>
<SOS> in malignant insulinomas mostly presenting with liver metastases aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice <EOS>
<SOS> mr spectroscopy is the only method for non invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans <EOS>
<SOS> while the 1h nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for mr imaging the mr spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei such as 13c 19f 23na 31p 39k and 87rb <EOS>
<SOS> clinical applications presently are confined to the 31p nucleus <EOS>
<SOS> 31p mr spectroscopy allows the non invasive study of cardiac high energy phosphate metabolites atp and phosphocreatine <EOS>
<SOS> the phosphocreatine atp ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart <EOS>
<SOS> possible clinical indications include heart failure valve disease and coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> in heart failure the phosphocreatine atp ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity ejection fraction and prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> in mitral and aortic valve disease a reduced phosphocreatine atp ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement <EOS>
<SOS> in coronary artery disease a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress biochemical ergometry may indicate local ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore absolute quantification of high energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability <EOS>
<SOS> major technical developments leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish mr spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool <EOS>
<SOS> a retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto orbital and midface advancement <EOS>
<SOS> the file data of <NUM> children with fronto orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> in addition lateral teleradiographies of <NUM> patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed <EOS>
<SOS> moreover late results of <NUM> children and <NUM> <NUM> adults with midface advancement with an average follow up period of <NUM> years were assessed <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to linear craniectomy and so called lateral canthal advancement in only 8 2 of cases 24 out of <NUM> patients were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto orbital advancement <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed <EOS>
<SOS> cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome related faciocraniosynostoses <EOS>
<SOS> in such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `saethre chotzen crouzon apert pfeiffer could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto orbital advancement <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies <EOS>
<SOS> in the present evaluation a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the indication for le fort ii osteotomy in the growth period should be limited <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task <EOS>
<SOS> many recall the famous experiments from clark et al <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> when he demonstrated liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons in the mammal species for the first time <EOS>
<SOS> after this hallmark perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of total and partial liquid ventilation tlv plv <EOS>
<SOS> perfluorocarbons saturated organofluorids have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application <EOS>
<SOS> the strong c f bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability biochemical inertness high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases low surface tension and high vapor pressures <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the high density of the pfc lead to radio opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of pfc liquid applied by tlv plv has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury <EOS>
<SOS> currently several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed recruitment of atelectatic alveoli prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli liquid peep redistribution of perfusion oxygen transport surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials phase i ii <EOS>
<SOS> however the results of the first randomised controlled study of plv in <NUM> adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure ali ards showed no differences between plv and conventional treatment <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces pneumothoraces and hypoxia <EOS>
<SOS> since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen the application of liquids even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic <EOS>
<SOS> to overcome these unwanted side effects we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents <EOS>
<SOS> after resolving some technical issues this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury <EOS>
<SOS> vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of <NUM> vol of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance <EOS>
<SOS> though these results are promising mechanisms of action dose efficacy relation surfactant perfluorocarbon interaction or anti inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear <EOS>
<SOS> these questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically <EOS>
<SOS> however the inhalation of vapor a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing continuous monitoring and demand application in a way near to clinical routine <EOS>
<SOS> vdd pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children <EOS>
<SOS> we have used <NUM> different standard adult size single pass leads and <NUM> different pacemaker generators in <NUM> children and adolescents aged <MOB> years mean <NUM> years and weighing <NUM> to <NUM> kg mean <NUM> kg <EOS>
<SOS> congenital complete heart block was present in <NUM> patients with associated heart disease in <NUM> of them surgical complete heart block in <NUM> patients and <NUM> av block of uncertain cause in <NUM> patient <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the vdd system was their first pacing system <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the patients 1 6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads 10 and or atrial leads 5 was performed <EOS>
<SOS> all leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture using the extraction sheath when present and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing <EOS>
<SOS> ventricular thresholds ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> v the minimal atrial amplitude was <NUM> to <NUM> mv and the maximum amplitude was <NUM> to <NUM> mv <EOS>
<SOS> there was one early micro displacement and the lead was repositioned <EOS>
<SOS> over a follow up period of 2 64 months mean <NUM> months all but <NUM> of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise <EOS>
<SOS> during this time some have undergone considerable growth <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patient atrial sensing was lost after cardiopulmonary bypass for additional cardiac surgery at <NUM> months and the pacemaker was programmed into vvir mode <EOS>
<SOS> one patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at <NUM> years but the pacing system had no fault at autopsy <EOS>
<SOS> the standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block <EOS>
<SOS> open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures <EOS>
<SOS> the internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws <EOS>
<SOS> the use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock <EOS>
<SOS> a newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented <EOS>
<SOS> it allows a safe semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach <EOS>
<SOS> a wide dissection at the outside of the pelvis is not necessary <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination revealed a lichenoid pseudolymphomatous infiltrative pattern that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy immunohistochemistry and molecular biology <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal allergic pathogenesis of non granulomatous tattoo reactions <EOS>
<SOS> therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas <EOS>
<SOS> interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils <EOS>
<SOS> in a series of <NUM> patients 34 procedures we consistently used gianturco coils which were the initially employed coils <EOS>
<SOS> they are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of embolization was high 28 in the first <NUM> procedures however it declined to <NUM> in the last <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> we modified the technique by partially blocking the duct when necessary with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils <EOS>
<SOS> there was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> minutes and decreased to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> minutes in the last <NUM> patients with successful closure <EOS>
<SOS> considering our experience we continue to recommend the use of gianturco coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost <EOS>
<SOS> this review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness <EOS>
<SOS> neuroanatomical research animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors <EOS>
<SOS> although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation <EOS>
<SOS> athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude <MOB> m to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level <EOS>
<SOS> as maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work outs <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations termed live high train low evolved opposing the conventional concept of live high train high <EOS>
<SOS> a third option using a hypobaric chamber live low train low is hardly used anymore for training athletes <EOS>
<SOS> studies on the effects of conventional high altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the new concept of live high train low there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high altitude training <EOS>
<SOS> however training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude specific physiologic factors or non altitude related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes <EOS>
<SOS> purpose to answer the following questions whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low field mri system magnetom open <NUM> t equipped with currently available hard and software components in comparison to high field system magnetom impact <NUM> t <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore whether localization of lesions suspect in mr mammography can be realized in mr system of low field magnetom open <NUM> t <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods in <NUM> patients suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic mr mammography acquired with high field system magnetom impact <NUM> t and were compared to low field mr mammographies of <NUM> t magnetom open <NUM> t <EOS>
<SOS> in six of the <NUM> patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking <EOS>
<SOS> results all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr mammography magnetom impact <NUM> t were also clearly identified in the <NUM> t system magnetom open <EOS>
<SOS> in six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of k <NUM> cm distance to the lesion <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion although studies in the <NUM> t system clearly showed inferior snr 34 6 vs 83 1 and cnr 14 6 vs 43 5 compared to studies with the high field system all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr mammography were reliably identified also in <NUM> t studies <EOS>
<SOS> due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality the magnetom open is suitable for interventions on the breast <EOS>
<SOS> children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration <EOS>
<SOS> supply them with a prosthesis orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> while a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity <EOS>
<SOS> orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations have a supporting effect allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening <EOS>
<SOS> just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the sooner the treatment starts the better the results <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of the present experiences with the inhalative application of nitric oxide no in term babies now the first promising reports about no application in preterm babies have been published <EOS>
<SOS> hiv remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs <EOS>
<SOS> hiv infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants <EOS>
<SOS> the human infectious dose of hiv is around <NUM> to <NUM> particles dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host <EOS>
<SOS> after inoculation new hiv is produced after <NUM> hours and hiv has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks <EOS>
<SOS> hiv infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays <EOS>
<SOS> anti hiv production might be slowed down under initial therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence <EOS>
<SOS> integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence <EOS>
<SOS> in our study <NUM> alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between <NUM> to <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients 89 were followed up after <NUM> <NUM> months <NUM> alcoholics 52 of the follow up sample 46 of the whole sample achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment mainly as inpatients <EOS>
<SOS> fifty four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment but achieved abstinence afterwards <NUM> 25 of these <NUM> patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy <NUM> alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in this subpopulation <NUM> 50 relapsed during the follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> although this is not a controlled study it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence <EOS>
<SOS> in this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38 year old patient <EOS>
<SOS> the initial diagnosis was herniated vertebral disk <EOS>
<SOS> although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations it took almost <NUM> months until the real reason was found <EOS>
<SOS> in this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies <EOS>
<SOS> neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus also known as thymic carcinoids are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum <EOS>
<SOS> they occur sporadically or in association with the men i syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> we present five patients four male one female age of first manifestation 19 53 years who were operated on at our hospital between <NUM> and <NUM> for neuroendocrine thymic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> a hormone producing tumor presented with cushing is syndrome in two patients <EOS>
<SOS> two patients had men i syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus <EOS>
<SOS> we found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one <EOS>
<SOS> the neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed <NUM> operations using a transthoracic or transsternal approach <EOS>
<SOS> since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> korsakoff is psychosis wernicke korsakoff syndrome following severe long term <NUM> alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and fluvoxamine <EOS>
<SOS> the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine d2 receptors <EOS>
<SOS> brain imaging studies however generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central d2 receptors among schizophrenic patients <EOS>
<SOS> using a novel approach the group of laruelle and abi dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum <EOS>
<SOS> endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine d2 receptors compared to healthy control subjects blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in d2 binding of the infused radioligand indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine <EOS>
<SOS> a similar increase in d2 binding was also observed in drug free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics these patients also showed an increased density of striatal d2 receptors most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of d2 receptors during neuroleptic medication <EOS>
<SOS> the columbia study provides an important indication of hyperdopaminergic function in schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare <EOS>
<SOS> there are only ten cases that have been previously described <EOS>
<SOS> three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas a so called oncocytomatosis <EOS>
<SOS> this report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy <EOS>
<SOS> in addition we found an adrenal adenoma a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices <NUM> years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung <EOS>
<SOS> in the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells with partial transition into microoncocytomas <EOS>
<SOS> immunhistochemically these and the main oncocytomas were cd <NUM> negative <EOS>
<SOS> these findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> cgh analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes <EOS>
<SOS> coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare <EOS>
<SOS> hitherto coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described <EOS>
<SOS> thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutical procedures therefore are derived from adult surgery with modifications to meet the specific need of the pediatric patient <EOS>
<SOS> the indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results <EOS>
<SOS> malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as for example lung cancer <EOS>
<SOS> however well established staging systems for non osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we present enneking is staging system for malign bone tumors here which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical radiological and histological findings <EOS>
<SOS> the weak points of enneking is staging system e g <EOS>
<SOS> inflexibility changes in radiological modalities in the past <NUM> years are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction acute occlusion of peripheral vessels or dissection perforation of major abdominal vessels <EOS>
<SOS> it was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in <NUM> circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> patients were randomly allocated to eight groups each receiving a different opioid within a clinical equipotent dose range buprenorphine fentanyl morphine nalbuphine pentazocine pethidine tramadol alfentanil <EOS>
<SOS> a complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5 10 15 and <NUM> min following opioid administration <EOS>
<SOS> monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status <EOS>
<SOS> statistical evaluation was performed by 1 and 2 factorial anova p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> significant time effects changes from baseline at the time of measurement were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance while significant group group specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure stroke volume index and pao2 <EOS>
<SOS> no major effects were observed following morphine fentanyl alfentanil tramadol and nalbuphine <EOS>
<SOS> buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone <EOS>
<SOS> pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in mpap and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression <EOS>
<SOS> for interpretation of the results factors such as respiratory depression histamine release secretion of endogenous catecholamines and hypoxia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> tramadol an opioid with moderate potency seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects <EOS>
<SOS> in this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament acl of the knee <EOS>
<SOS> the tourniquet pressure was <NUM> mm hg and operation time was <NUM> h after the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion <EOS>
<SOS> increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over <NUM> mm hg was found <EOS>
<SOS> the compartment was released immediately <EOS>
<SOS> despite the appearance of severe muscle damage no extensive débridement was done <EOS>
<SOS> at the second examination at <NUM> h there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> clinically there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> the case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined <EOS>
<SOS> continuous epidural analgesia masks the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries especially shoulder instability <EOS>
<SOS> the investigation was performed on <NUM> fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint <EOS>

<SOS> the measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability superior anterior anterior inferior inferior posterior inferior posterior <EOS>
<SOS> measurement was done using a specially developed strain gauge system <EOS>
<SOS> it was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomical 0 position of the glenohumeral joint in <NUM> <NUM> ° of abduction is a position of about <NUM> <NUM> ° of external rotation compared to the 0 position for clinical measurement <EOS>
<SOS> from the therapy point of view one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint <EOS>

<SOS> tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a tonsural pattern of alopecia over the crown extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the nape of the neck <EOS>
<SOS> it differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality <EOS>

<SOS> there is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials rcts <EOS>
<SOS> for geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long term care analogous evidence is still lacking <EOS>
<SOS> the nation wide leading boards of the frg is sickness insurance administration in conjunction with its central medical service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long term care insurance legislation rehabilitation prior to long term care <EOS>
<SOS> these guidelines must be proven empirically <EOS>
<SOS> to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service the rct design would be highly desirable <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium term sensitivity to change do not yet exist <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless there is a great and urgent need for the first time to investigate the cost effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the frg leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control groups <EOS>
<SOS> idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the underlying reasons and mechanisms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia <EOS>
<SOS> these described abnormalities were not uniform <EOS>
<SOS> here we report about a patient suffering from drug refractory idiopathic ventricular tachycardia for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> this is the first report in which the origin of an idiopathic ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right ventricular angiography magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation <EOS>
<SOS> fetal teratomas are extra or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization <EOS>
<SOS> although they are rare they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> if sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality as exemplified by <NUM> prenatally examined fetal teratomas <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 62 year old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so called michaelis gutmann bodies leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon <EOS>
<SOS> no other organs were found affected <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of an antibiotic therapy there was no melena detectable over a period of six months <EOS>
<SOS> malakoplakia an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract is rarely found in the colon with only <NUM> cases published until now <EOS>
<SOS> it is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse <EOS>
<SOS> this spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease <EOS>
<SOS> unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a ule is a self limited probably infectious allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children <EOS>
<SOS> we describe five such cases <EOS>
<SOS> the typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red partly confluent papules and fine scales <EOS>
<SOS> two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ule <EOS>
<SOS> due to its asymptomatic course therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases <EOS>
<SOS> minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy <EOS>
<SOS> as in open surgery several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described <EOS>
<SOS> in principle one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access <EOS>
<SOS> all adrenal tumors pheochromocytomas included except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically <EOS>
<SOS> however the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the results reported to date are convincing <EOS>
<SOS> only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy <EOS>
<SOS> because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that for the present will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery <EOS>
<SOS> economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field <EOS>
<SOS> this survey is objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> 8 data banks <NUM> key words from the psychotherapeutic field and <NUM> economic key words were used the identified original studies were classified in accordance with drummond the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between <NUM> and <NUM> points <EOS>
<SOS> 21 studies were found <NUM> cost benefit analyses <NUM> cost effectiveness analyses and one cost utility analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of the representation of the clinical results mean value 8 6 was better than that of the economic results mean value 6 1 <EOS>
<SOS> it was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the evaluation type of cost utility analysis which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field has been greatly ignored <EOS>
<SOS> as a net effect of ace inhibitors and at1 receptor antagonists on the renin angiotensin system ras cardioprotection due to vasodilative reduction of blood pressure afterload reduction antiproliferative reduced cell growth reduction of vascular andor ventricular remodeling reduced formation of extracellular matrix as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis reduction of blood pressure preload reduction can be expected <EOS>
<SOS> these aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ace inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction no comparable data are available for at1 receptor antagonists <EOS>
<SOS> to date an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ace inhibitors <EOS>
<SOS> this effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ace inhibitors and at1 receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs the dual action of ace inhibitors on the ras and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side effects mainly chronic dry cough in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8 14 <EOS>
<SOS> this respective side effect can be prevented by the use of at1 receptor antagonists <EOS>
<SOS> it has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ace inhibitors on at1 receptor mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high <MOB> as compared to other substances <EOS>
<SOS> due to their direct action at1 receptor blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> a combination of the ace inhibitor mediated activation of the kinin system with the more specific blockade of at1 receptors by at1 receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation <EOS>
<SOS> finally it has been discussed that the incresed at ii concentration in case of at1 receptor blockade activates at2 receptor mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect <EOS>
<SOS> an isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease specific skin reaction <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the development of the koebner phenomenon in a <NUM> year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with uvb at a dose above 0 055 j cm2 <EOS>

<SOS> the presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after <NUM> h to <NUM> days of nicotine free time was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> following stimulation of the eccrine glands sweat samples were taken every hour for <NUM> h the total nicotine concentrations i e <EOS>
<SOS> the sum of nicotine and its metabolites were determined by radioimmunoassay <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry <EOS>
<SOS> up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis ic since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized double blinded or placebo controlled <EOS>
<SOS> numerous case reports and intent to treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence based medicine criteria <EOS>
<SOS> consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of ic <EOS>
<SOS> differential radiomodification induced by 2 deoxy d glucose 2 dg is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> our earlier work on ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 dg <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible <EOS>
<SOS> the promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2 dg has been further evaluated in the ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response <EOS>
<SOS> solid tumors average volume <NUM> <NUM> cm3 implanted in swiss albino strain a mice were focally irradiated 10 gy using 60co teletherapy <EOS>
<SOS> tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31p mr spectroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 dg was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives <EOS>
<SOS> upon hematoporphyrin derivatives 2 dg treatment followed by irridiation the intracellular ph reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed <EOS>
<SOS> the present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2 dg in a mice ehrlich ascites tumor model <EOS>
<SOS> the finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the novel lenz 1835 by the german author social revolutionist and physician georg büchner <MOB> can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine <EOS>
<SOS> on the one hand büchner is description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria on the other he hints at the physician is modern general attitude toward the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives <EOS>
<SOS> the hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia <EOS>
<SOS> data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to 1 increase in ongoing activity <NUM> 2 lowering in stimulation threshold and 3 increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors <EOS>
<SOS> if similar changes occur also in patients an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by 1 spontaneous pain ongoing activity 2 tenderness lowering in mechanical threshold and 3 hyperalgesia increased responses to noxious stimuli <EOS>
<SOS> these changes should affect mainly deep pain because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors <EOS>
<SOS> animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region <EOS>
<SOS> clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of <NUM> years observation <EOS>
<SOS> the present trial was continued in order to determine the long term behavior of ionomer cement ionos partial and total ossicles after reconstruction of the ossicular chain <EOS>

<SOS> follow up extended over a maximum period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals <EOS>
<SOS> preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd is not presently performed in germany <EOS>
<SOS> according to pgd is opponents there existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics <EOS>
<SOS> proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of pgd depending on legal viewpoint <EOS>
<SOS> this controversy has hindered pgd is application in germany <EOS>
<SOS> the nature of this longstanding emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad <EOS>
<SOS> this retrospective study investigated the stability of the small ao external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of <NUM> mostly unstable distal radius fractures types a 3 2 c 1 2 and c 2 1 according to the ao classification <EOS>
<SOS> no bone grafting was performed <EOS>

<SOS> the concept of small volume resuscitation the rapid infusion of a small volume 4 ml kg bw of hyperosmolar <MOB> saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago <EOS>
<SOS> numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre shock values <EOS>
<SOS> most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality <EOS>
<SOS> a meta analysis of preclinical studies from north and south america however has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5 1 following small volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care <EOS>
<SOS> moreover small volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased icp and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the utility of electron beam computed tomography ebt to estimate cerebral blood volume cbv and cerebral blood flow cbf was evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the ebt was performed with an acquisition time of <NUM> ms per slice at eight parallel levels <EOS>
<SOS> to compare signal noise and contrast noise ratios the data from the ebt investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral ct <EOS>
<SOS> the signal noise ratio with ebt was about 30 the contrast noise ratio 25 of that with spiral ct <EOS>
<SOS> the absolute values of cbv were <NUM> <NUM> ml 100 g ebt cbf was <NUM> <NUM> ml 100 g min in normal contralateral brain tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in four patients with proven infarcts on follow up the ischemic areas had a cbv ranging from <NUM> to <NUM> ml 100 g while cbf ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> ml 100 g min <EOS>
<SOS> using a bolus injection of contrast material calculation of absolute cbv and cbf is feasible using ebt <EOS>
<SOS> advantages of ebt are the absolute measurements possible and it is multislice capability <EOS>
<SOS> disadvantages however are caused by the high image noise limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the report in two parts sums up the findings of a survey covering <NUM> cities in central europe <EOS>
<SOS> most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons but this has been more or less unsuccessful <EOS>
<SOS> information campaigns were used on a large scale along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down providing pigeon houses administering hormone preparations chemosterilization and exclusion from buildings <EOS>

<SOS> population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible <EOS>
<SOS> we report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat <EOS>
<SOS> apart from the high speed 100 km h or more the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident <EOS>
<SOS> a 41 year old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis <EOS>
<SOS> she was found unconscious without measurable blood pressure the electrocardiogram ecg showed bradycardia of 30 min and the rectal temperature was <NUM> <NUM> °c <EOS>
<SOS> the patient received mechanical ventilation fluid therapy warmed gastric lavage and unfortunately inotropic medication <EOS>
<SOS> she was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass cpb <EOS>
<SOS> on arrival the patient had a rectal temperature of <NUM> <NUM> °c the ecg showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70 min and the blood pressure was 63 43 mm hg <EOS>
<SOS> we decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient <EOS>
<SOS> vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a shaldon catheter <EOS>
<SOS> the hemofiltration system gambro ak 10 gambro ab sweden was instituted with a blood flow rate of <NUM> ml min <EOS>
<SOS> the hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to <NUM> <NUM> °c <EOS>
<SOS> sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of <NUM> <NUM> °c and within <NUM> h the patient was rewarmed to <NUM> <NUM> °c <EOS>
<SOS> after treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved <EOS>
<SOS> under these circumstances it is preferable to external rewarming techniques as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock <EOS>
<SOS> rewarming rates of <NUM> <NUM> °c h seem to be adequate <EOS>
<SOS> hemofiltration systems are more widespread less invasive and easier to handle compared to cpb techniques which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures <EOS>

<SOS> a mean of 19 1 sd 3 6 puva bath treatments were carried out <EOS>
<SOS> the mean cumulative uva dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16 7 sd 4 8 j cm2 <EOS>
<SOS> no side effects were seen except an increased phototoxic reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema <EOS>
<SOS> the results of this trial show that puva bath photochemotherapy with 8 mop is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive exanthematic and also hypertrophic hyperkeratotic lichen planus <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to oral puva therapy and puva bath therapy using 4 5 8 trimethoxypsoralen balneophotochemotherapy with 8 mop shows an excellent efficiency side effect correlation <EOS>
<SOS> the clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8 mop demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus <EOS>

<SOS> typical clinical signs of cip are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration a symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis plegia that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes and muscular atrophy <EOS>
<SOS> this article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes physiopathological concepts therapeutic implications and the complex differential diagnosis of cip from a neurological point of view focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> the data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to deduce a clinical definition of cip <EOS>
<SOS> it is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies <EOS>
<SOS> these studies show clearly that midlife is a developmental phase of its own the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development <EOS>

<SOS> pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation <EOS>
<SOS> flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements <EOS>
<SOS> uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally <EOS>
<SOS> when the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals <EOS>
<SOS> body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls <EOS>
<SOS> umbilical blood flow in iugr animals was lower than in controls <EOS>
<SOS> the relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age <EOS>
<SOS> chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes iugr accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation <EOS>

<SOS> the aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of co2 during computer enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function <EOS>
<SOS> methods transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in <NUM> patients undergoing the above mentioned operation <EOS>
<SOS> at distinct time points during the intervention a cine loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view <EOS>
<SOS> simultaneously oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic co2 pressure were taken <EOS>
<SOS> wall motion analysis was done postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> results with increasing duration of single lung ventilation significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected <EOS>
<SOS> this was accompanied by a decrease in pao2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic co2 pressure <EOS>
<SOS> these alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion these results show that computer enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function <EOS>
<SOS> this can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic co2 insufflation <EOS>
<SOS> however in our group these alteration showed only small clinical relevance <EOS>
<SOS> during the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser like systems for photoepilation and their one sided representation in media has led to confusion among pysicians and patients <EOS>

<SOS> calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date <EOS>
<SOS> previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction <EOS>
<SOS> the relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves st jude medical bioimplant is assessed by sudan red ii staining to show preexisting lipids <EOS>
<SOS> all porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees <EOS>
<SOS> five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the sudan red stained fatty areas <EOS>
<SOS> comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57 66 <EOS>
<SOS> two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with hematoxylin and von kossa is stain respectively <EOS>
<SOS> by light microscopy the von kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits <EOS>
<SOS> these preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue <EOS>
<SOS> substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification <EOS>
<SOS> therapy for hip dysplasia and ddh by means of sonography <EOS>
<SOS> numerous methods are available for treating congenital dysplasia of the hip cdh <EOS>
<SOS> the important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads <EOS>
<SOS> a historical review of the diagnosis of so called congenital dysplasia and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given <EOS>
<SOS> generally a three step plan of treatment is recommended dislocated heads must be reduced after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable <EOS>
<SOS> this is followed by maturation period until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified <EOS>
<SOS> all hip joints regardless of age can be assigned to one of these phases <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head <EOS>
<SOS> to prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis the reduction retention position should be more than <NUM> <NUM> ° flexion in the hip joint but not more than 45 50 <NUM> ° abduction <EOS>
<SOS> in each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint <EOS>
<SOS> the appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation <EOS>
<SOS> each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three phase treatment system <EOS>
<SOS> in this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment phase can be chosen <EOS>
<SOS> a case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery <EOS>
<SOS> molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state <EOS>
<SOS> these processes of activation include very reactive intermediates <EOS>
<SOS> therefore aerobic cells must cope with and to some extent also adapt to oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the strength of these impacts several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal steady state metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions two electron transitions to increased homolytic reactions one electron transitions is observed <EOS>
<SOS> homolytic reactions produce free radicals which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits <EOS>
<SOS> at advanced states of stress control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate <EOS>
<SOS> finally cellular decompartmentalizations yield apoptotic lytic and or necrotic processes <EOS>
<SOS> every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro and antioxidative capacities <EOS>
<SOS> antioxidants which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics probably as the most prominent ones <EOS>
<SOS> in this article mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported <EOS>

<SOS> examination of the ears using a microscope rhinoscopy stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4 <NUM> and <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> out of a total of <NUM> children studied between the ages of <NUM> to <NUM> years <NUM> could be analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> at the end of the study no operation was required in 70 7 of the placebo treated children and in 78 1 of the children treated with homeopathic preparations <EOS>
<SOS> these results show no statistical significance <EOS>
<SOS> a treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws which combined cranio caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk <EOS>
<SOS> for a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio caudal direction a 5 field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields <EOS>
<SOS> three fields adjoining in cranio caudal direction were completed by <NUM> fields enclosing the whole target volume <EOS>
<SOS> the matching line was measured and calculated with helax tms© <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore a 4 field box and opposing fields were planned <EOS>
<SOS> the dose volume histograms for target bladder intestine and soft tissue were exported <EOS>
<SOS> normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability respectively were calculated for all techniques <EOS>
<SOS> in the region of the matching line the summation of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6 0 caudal and 4 5 cranial respectively <EOS>
<SOS> for fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2 0 caudal and 1 8 cranial respectively <EOS>
<SOS> for the dose profiles calculated with helax tms© no overdose was found <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques whereas the tumor control remains the same <EOS>
<SOS> in specific cases a technique with cranio caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk <EOS>
<SOS> disseminated langerhans cell histiocytosis lch is most frequent in children at the age of 1 3 years seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly <EOS>

<SOS> in the aids stage polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections most often with cytomegalovirus cmv or m tuberculosis or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis <EOS>
<SOS> mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated cmv infection <EOS>
<SOS> myopathies can occur in all stages of hiv infection their frequency is about 1 <EOS>
<SOS> primary polymyositis associated with hiv which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine <EOS>
<SOS> other forms of myopathy are very rare <EOS>
<SOS> 54 patients who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital were interviewed again in their homes three months later <EOS>
<SOS> contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters the variability was high in the scales that were used <EOS>
<SOS> explanations for these results are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> at a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors <EOS>
<SOS> health care costs have risen considerably since <NUM> in all industrialized countries <EOS>
<SOS> this has several causes changes in demographic structure the large number of physicians increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges wage increases and last but not least medical progress <EOS>
<SOS> advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care <EOS>
<SOS> careful analyses reveal however that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high technology ct mr imaging <EOS>
<SOS> the legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained <EOS>
<SOS> relevant suggestions such as generally accepted examination strategies should be realized with the help of the scientific societies <EOS>
<SOS> background main features of the coffin siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes <EOS>
<SOS> further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips sparse scalp hair and hypertrichosis <EOS>
<SOS> we report on two premature infants who had completed <NUM> and <NUM> weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung <EOS>
<SOS> by selective intubation of the respective main bronchus complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> days case 1 and after <NUM> days case 2 the unilateral emphysema receded and subsequently bilateral respiration was possible without relapse <EOS>
<SOS> 6 and respectively <NUM> days after selective intubation extubation was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the two children were discharged at the age of 41 2 and 21 2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides <EOS>
<SOS> patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa davies colley presented with multiple cutaneous horns <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical picture the histology the electro microscopic examination the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures <EOS>
<SOS> epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel is health <EOS>
<SOS> nitrous oxide n2o oxidises vitamin b12 and thus decreases dna production by inactivation of methionine synthase <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the united states and most european health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks <EOS>
<SOS> these values range from <NUM> to <NUM> ppm expressed as time weighted averages twa <EOS>
<SOS> there is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to quantify levels of n2o in a recovery room rr with an air conditioning system <EOS>
<SOS> the blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury <EOS>
<SOS> several protocols have been published for optimized management but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> as part of a prospective study <NUM> patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic c clamp <EOS>
<SOS> beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a bloodvolume equivalent <EOS>
<SOS> 18 of the <NUM> patients had an injury severety according to group ii and iv of the hannover polytrauma score pts <EOS>
<SOS> concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in <NUM> cases 23 injuries concommitant urological injuries in <NUM> cases 14 injuries <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in <NUM> cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed <EOS>
<SOS> 11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury <NUM> patients survived <EOS>
<SOS> although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors a 44 higher subsequent blood substitution <NUM> <NUM> ml was observed in the nonsurvivor group <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma <EOS>
<SOS> the estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation pelvic clamps surgical exploration and tamponade <EOS>
<SOS> this calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to childhood intussusception the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific <EOS>

<SOS> in this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61 year old male following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy the clinical symptoms diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described <EOS>
<SOS> sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to childhood intussusception operative treatment is preferred in adults <EOS>
<SOS> the term frontal lobe syndrome comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex <EOS>
<SOS> however similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks <EOS>
<SOS> with respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area <EOS>
<SOS> as intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed <EOS>
<SOS> the case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury n 2 or cerebrovascular disease n 2 are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients their family and personnel <EOS>
<SOS> a lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine which in turn makes an impression on public opinion and disturbs the reputation of the co workers in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> to form an objective view we carried out a survey of <NUM> co workers 11 physicians <NUM> from the nursing staff and <NUM> ancillary personnel regarding the medical technology the environment in the unit general medical questions and the extent of intensive care therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1 240 months median <NUM> months the ages ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> years median <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> of those questioned 73 <NUM> found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful 100 of the physicians and only 57 of the nursing staff were of this opinion <EOS>
<SOS> only 9 of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear inducing for the patients in contrast 61 of the nursing staff believed this to be true <EOS>
<SOS> the noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65 of the nursing staff and 45 of the physicians <EOS>
<SOS> only 22 of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit 48 felt that they were unhappy or even miserable <EOS>
<SOS> of the physicians 46 believed that the patients were comfortable <EOS>
<SOS> of the nursing staff 100 were of the opinion that for the deceased patients organ substitution therapy had continued too long <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand only 45 of the residents shared this opinion <EOS>
<SOS> the medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion <EOS>
<SOS> this could possibly be caused by insecurity lack of information and lack of successful experiences <EOS>
<SOS> next to patient outcome the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> in this pilot study <NUM> patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with <NUM> million iu interferon alpha 2a roferon a three times weekly for <NUM> weeks and followed up for a further <NUM> weeks <NUM> patients showed clear and <NUM> a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions <NUM> patient got worse <EOS>
<SOS> pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients and ige levels showed no change during and after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> all patients noted mild transient flu like symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate <EOS>
<SOS> shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality <EOS>
<SOS> coagulation abnormalities ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin ogen degradation products are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning <EOS>
<SOS> fifteen patients were treated with 1 5 5 e kg body weight low dose group the others received 8 15 e kg high dose group <EOS>
<SOS> our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters such as d dimer tat and ptf <NUM> <NUM> in the high dose group without any bleeding disorder <EOS>
<SOS> thus we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with lmwh as shown above <EOS>
<SOS> background laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate <EOS>
<SOS> methods all patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from <NUM> to <NUM> were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short and long term results <EOS>
<SOS> results laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in only <NUM> patients was an adenoma stage 0 found and <NUM> patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection <EOS>
<SOS> an oncological resection was performed in <NUM> patients <EOS>

<SOS> no port site metastases were found <EOS>
<SOS> two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> the second patient developed bilateral lung metastases <EOS>
<SOS> only one patient died during the follow up period because of myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion although the follow up is short it seems that the recurrence rate is low <EOS>
<SOS> controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34 year old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness rüsch endotracheal tube <EOS>
<SOS> some hours later she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted <EOS>
<SOS> reintubation with a high volume low pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the rüsch tube was grossly overinflated <EOS>
<SOS> endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than <NUM> cm h2o the maximum measurement possible with the manometer <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3 cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch <EOS>
<SOS> to maintain low airway pressures post operatively she remained sedated for <NUM> days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure controlled ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> in this case it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture <EOS>
<SOS> other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections accounting for about 40 of all nosocomial infections <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters <EOS>
<SOS> the guideline from the centers for disease control and prevention atlanta usa for the prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infections as the most important evidence based guideline worldwide was published in <NUM> and has not been updated so far <EOS>
<SOS> evidence based national guidelines are not available in germany <EOS>
<SOS> we have therefore performed a literature search for randomized controlled studies on the prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infections medline cochrane library reference text books published since <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified <EOS>
<SOS> substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials <EOS>

<SOS> the differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and especially in the case of pnet malignant lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative chemotherapy and down staging can improve the operability and <NUM> prognosis especially in pnet <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with renal or hepatic failure the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways leading to the necessity to correct the dose <EOS>
<SOS> the liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids <EOS>
<SOS> the major metabolic pathway is oxidation <EOS>
<SOS> exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine which undergo primarily glucuronidation and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis <EOS>
<SOS> the hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency <EOS>
<SOS> some metabolites such as morphine 6 glucuronide m6g or normeperidine are active opioid agonists <EOS>
<SOS> with high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression <EOS>
<SOS> in addition special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures <EOS>
<SOS> few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported <EOS>
<SOS> the elimination half life of these drugs was prolonged <EOS>
<SOS> lastly the disposition of methadone buprenorphine fentanyl sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure <EOS>
<SOS> backgrounds aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults 13c urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with helicobacter pylori <EOS>
<SOS> methods in <NUM> asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an elisa test specific for helicobacter pylori <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal <EOS>
<SOS> results with the serological or histological result as reference method the cut off value for children delta value <NUM> permil has shown a sensitivity specificity of <NUM> 95 or <NUM> 100 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly <EOS>
<SOS> 30 minutes after 13c urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion our modification of the 13c urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an helicobacter pylori infection <EOS>
<SOS> this review summarizes some aspects of german pediatrics as it developed after world war ii <EOS>
<SOS> having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation <EOS>
<SOS> as in other countries the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations and by economic restrictions <EOS>
<SOS> national specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan <EOS>
<SOS> the need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties <EOS>
<SOS> aim of this study was to isolate t lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to chlamydia antigens <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease <EOS>
<SOS> however since october <NUM> a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> at four hospitals in the saarland germany <NUM> cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the case history and clinical findings the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased igm titer <EOS>
<SOS> none of the patients had been previously vaccinated <EOS>
<SOS> the main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination one which has almost no side effects <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this study is to describe the disease present our own results and indicate the need for vaccination <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to providing information a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination <EOS>
<SOS> although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination <EOS>
<SOS> neurofibromas café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von recklinghausen is neurofibromatosis nf 1 <EOS>
<SOS> less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the case of a 21 year old vietnamese woman who showed generalized multiple neurofibromas a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and lisch nodules <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there were several large grey blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment bearing cells in the dermis which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots <EOS>
<SOS> in the right zygomatic region she presented a grey blue hair bearing macule which we saw as a variant of ota is naevus <EOS>
<SOS> a genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed as both schwann is cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest <EOS>
<SOS> such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of nf 1 and dermal melanocytic nevi <EOS>
<SOS> infectious agents may directly or indirectly through the response of the host is immune system modulate the growth of vascular cells <EOS>
<SOS> local and or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of re stenosis in the vascular tree <EOS>
<SOS> further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis <EOS>
<SOS> their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions <EOS>
<SOS> besides other reasons cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient <EOS>
<SOS> since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk <EOS>
<SOS> routine ecg however is not indicated in patients under <NUM> years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over <NUM> years of age <EOS>
<SOS> the validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results <EOS>
<SOS> by preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients thus in patients of asa risk groups i ii younger than <NUM> years of age routine chest x ray cannot be justified <EOS>
<SOS> in patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ecg is ambiguous dipyridamole thallium myocardial scintigraphy dtms and dobutamine stress echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events <EOS>
<SOS> in that respect dobutamine stress echocardiography appears to be superior to dtms <EOS>
<SOS> the laboratory tests required in patients of different asa risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview <EOS>
<SOS> generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> both neuropathic critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathic critical illness myopathy abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness <EOS>
<SOS> this article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> an efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes <EOS>
<SOS> psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible <EOS>
<SOS> modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> the use of high resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation <EOS>
<SOS> this development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands <EOS>
<SOS> unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish <EOS>
<SOS> modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre findings by other clinics <EOS>
<SOS> great importance however must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists <EOS>
<SOS> we report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the charité <EOS>
<SOS> infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure significant perioperative complications and limb loss <EOS>

<SOS> radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the radiosurgical device leksell gamma knife lgk was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments <EOS>
<SOS> high quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery <EOS>
<SOS> the target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below <NUM> mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was <NUM> cm3 <EOS>
<SOS> quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first <NUM> consecutive treatments <EOS>
<SOS> these values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters <EOS>
<SOS> an analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery <EOS>
<SOS> a highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the lgk on the other could be shown <EOS>
<SOS> this result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results <EOS>
<SOS> even if ignaz philipp semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures especially the hand disinfection <EOS>
<SOS> he has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health care personnel act as vehicles <EOS>
<SOS> as a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target <EOS>
<SOS> the impact of his doctrine not only made him saviour of the mothers but also justifies to regard him as father of the obstetric infection prevention if not even as the founder of the modern science based hospital hygiene <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard x ray images <EOS>
<SOS> our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the x ray image <EOS>
<SOS> when we know the exact shape of these two components we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay <EOS>
<SOS> first results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task <EOS>
<SOS> most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with borrelia burgdorferi <EOS>
<SOS> erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite <EOS>
<SOS> after hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in europe as described in the case of a <NUM> 1 2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine <EOS>
<SOS> one year follow up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis <EOS>

<SOS> resection specimens of <NUM> patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three step regression grading system grade i no or only slight tumor regression grade ii incomplete tumor regression grade ii complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis foam cell rim vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen <EOS>
<SOS> this morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci however argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer <EOS>

<SOS> this study found intraoperative use of 5 fu to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower iop in the direct postoperative phase <EOS>
<SOS> however this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone but might be of toxic origin <EOS>
<SOS> a postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery <EOS>
<SOS> clinical signs laboratory findings ultrasound and erc lead to diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients the fistula healed within <NUM> days after placement of the tube <EOS>
<SOS> two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess and in <NUM> patients drainage of a bilioma was performed <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases with biliary peritonitis a step by step lavage was necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract <EOS>
<SOS> description of a <NUM> years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes which requires dialysis and tertiary hyperparathyroidism who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> characteristic of this syndrome there occured soft tissue calcification mediacalcinosis of the small and medium sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis is not completely clear but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants in a sensitized organism at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon could lead to calcium deposits <EOS>
<SOS> these are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue <EOS>
<SOS> lungs stomach kidneys cutis heart and vascular system are most frequently involved <EOS>
<SOS> treatment is primarily supportive an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines <EOS>
<SOS> recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy <EOS>
<SOS> the cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented and the importance of the association of latex and cross reactivity with food items is stressed <EOS>
<SOS> the food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado banana avocado and buckwheat and banana avocado and tomato <EOS>
<SOS> the cross reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before <EOS>
<SOS> the branchio oto renal syndrome bor syndrome is characterized by auricular abnormalities lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags <EOS>
<SOS> the hearing impairment may be a conductive a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss <EOS>
<SOS> the renal disease is oligomeganephronia a bilateral congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons <EOS>
<SOS> the bor syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease <EOS>
<SOS> corneal metabolism is reduced after cataract extraction <EOS>
<SOS> the available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from <NUM> to <NUM> was reviewed in four parts <EOS>
<SOS> the co2 laser myringotomy is a current low pain procedure for middle ear ventilation for secretory otitis media som that can be performed under topical anesthesia even in children <EOS>
<SOS> the duration of middle ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created <EOS>
<SOS> perforations with a diameter greater than <NUM> mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately <NUM> weeks thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes <EOS>
<SOS> to date the co2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope <EOS>
<SOS> the co2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system <EOS>
<SOS> the incorporation of a small inexpen sive co2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in som therapy <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described <EOS>
<SOS> however no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity <EOS>
<SOS> 17 patients mean age <NUM> 45 74 with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy 1 6 cycles with a cisplatin dose of <NUM> mg m2 <EOS>
<SOS> amifostine <MOB> mg m2 was administered intravenously <NUM> minutes prior to chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> for all patients creatinine clearance serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle <EOS>
<SOS> a group of <NUM> patients mean age <NUM> 51 67 did undergo mvec chemotherapy 1 4 cycles without receiving amifostine and served as control group <EOS>
<SOS> amifostine was well tolerated and only <NUM> patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the <NUM> patients with known renal insufficiency mean creatinine clearance was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml min prior to and <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml min after chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> in the control group however creatinine clearance dropped from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml min to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ml min after completion of mvec chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly 1 1 mg dl prior to and <NUM> mg dl after chemotherapy magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in <NUM> and <NUM> of the patients in the amifostine group and in <NUM> and <NUM> of the patients in the control group <EOS>
<SOS> amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia cll by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking <EOS>
<SOS> immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small <NUM> number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid csf samples <EOS>
<SOS> molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of cll <EOS>
<SOS> we present an <NUM> old patient who was diagnosed with cll five years ago <EOS>
<SOS> despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal <NUM> involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging mri nor conventional csf analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis <EOS>
<SOS> using pcr we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone specific cdr3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain igh in dna obtained from both csf and peripheral blood cells <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of pcr products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single dna fragment respectively indicating the presence of a <NUM> monoclonal cell population in both <NUM> compartments <EOS>
<SOS> dna sequence analysis of the amplified cdr3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of cll <EOS>
<SOS> in the orthopedic department of the university hospital homburg saar we use since <NUM> a computer based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations <EOS>
<SOS> hardware consists of dos windows pc is in a novell network <EOS>
<SOS> our software is a combination of datbase system for managing patient data and a special coding program for icd and ikpm digits <EOS>
<SOS> our experience shows that computer assisted clinic management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation <EOS>
<SOS> until now we used the system for <NUM> <NUM> patients and <NUM> operations <EOS>
<SOS> a flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration <EOS>
<SOS> moreover in the university hospital homburg saar the different departments are linked by an intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the internet <EOS>
<SOS> in one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections <EOS>
<SOS> the microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci streptococci e coli and in case of chronical recurrent discharge also b fragilis and peptostreptococci <EOS>
<SOS> the symptoms are itching burning dysuria discharge and rubor of the vulva <EOS>
<SOS> a systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls <EOS>
<SOS> a desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated <EOS>
<SOS> excellently a single dose application being sufficient burning itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence so that the healing process is accelerated <EOS>
<SOS> the author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery <EOS>
<SOS> the differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed <EOS>
<SOS> two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego structure <EOS>
<SOS> then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour especially those of the group of fonagy and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes <EOS>
<SOS> general and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived <EOS>
<SOS> especially the relationship to the theories of bion ogden and winnicott is estimated <EOS>
<SOS> the situation of psychiatric patients in the ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country <EOS>
<SOS> in the larger cities so called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients <EOS>
<SOS> however no other social psychiatric institutions exist <EOS>
<SOS> here the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in kiev and shitomir as examples <EOS>
<SOS> undertreatment is also a problem because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the ukraine <EOS>
<SOS> import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems <EOS>
<SOS> improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in ukraine <EOS>
<SOS> renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to 1996 <NUM> children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department <EOS>
<SOS> patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis ultrasonography and urinary analysis <EOS>
<SOS> in specific cases iv urography ct scan and or angiography were applied <EOS>
<SOS> we used the organ injury scale ois for classification of renal trauma into five grades <EOS>
<SOS> the result of a b scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used b system the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator <EOS>
<SOS> the estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters independent of the type of the used b system is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of b scan images <EOS>
<SOS> results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented <EOS>
<SOS> 329 persons were interviewed three times quantitative study and <NUM> persons conducted a semi structured diary qualitative study covering in both groups a two year period from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement <EOS>
<SOS> they were asked about their subjective well being happiness joy satisfaction stresses their life situation and their personal social and material resources <EOS>
<SOS> the results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains leisure time and losses financial social status but overall maintains a high level of well being <EOS>
<SOS> specific analyses point out inter individual differences risk factors and resources like a high level of trait well being health social networks and an optimistic outlook <EOS>
<SOS> the diary analyses lead to specifications more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects <EOS>
<SOS> consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence group i problems associated with access group ii introduction of the endovascular stent a release of the main segment b anchoring the second limb and group ii incidence of primary endoleaks <EOS>
<SOS> interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic hematological and oncological diseases for years <EOS>
<SOS> recently interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> a 41 year old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non tender palm sized cutaneous subcutaneous reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after <NUM> weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections <EOS>
<SOS> histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis <EOS>
<SOS> interferon beta therapy was discontinued for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> with topical corticosteroids the skin lesions resolved <EOS>
<SOS> when subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain <EOS>
<SOS> slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described <EOS>
<SOS> however no reports of large painful cutaneous subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published <EOS>
<SOS> in adults infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance <EOS>
<SOS> in conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates <EOS>
<SOS> these changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease <EOS>
<SOS> however in szintigraphy and mrt pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days <EOS>
<SOS> thus early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible <EOS>
<SOS> in early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body subchondral anterobasal ventral central <EOS>
<SOS> apparently a soft tissue tumor is associated <EOS>
<SOS> sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes <EOS>
<SOS> after at least <NUM> weeks computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester <EOS>
<SOS> in addition mrt as well as ct can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal <EOS>
<SOS> the tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> clinical findings affection of several vertebral bodies large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis but these findings are not specific of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis e g amyloid or crystal arthropathies may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space which is a rare finding in spondylitis <EOS>
<SOS> to show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> we examinated <NUM> cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial <NUM> healthy patients with <NUM> to 20 mhz probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region <EOS>
<SOS> especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic saving of expenses lack of radiation side to side comparison <EOS>
<SOS> an essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment melanins <EOS>
<SOS> toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> as the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour <EOS>
<SOS> the natural hair colour of <NUM> subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart wella darmstadt germany <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the ciel a b values were determined <EOS>
<SOS> the descriptive categorisation of the hair colours e g <EOS>
<SOS> blonde brown black could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results <EOS>
<SOS> sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison <EOS>
<SOS> when the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible <EOS>
<SOS> we measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing wobadd at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support ips 5 10 <NUM> mbar above positive end expiratory pressure peep and in a new ventilatory mode automatic tube compensation atc in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency ari <EOS>
<SOS> in atc endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure <EOS>
<SOS> pressure support in this mode i e airway pressure above peep is equal to the actual flow dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube ett <EOS>
<SOS> airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end <EOS>
<SOS> as the tube resistance of ett seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient airway pressure is reduced below peep during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration <EOS>
<SOS> the result is a near constant tracheal pressure at peep both during inspiration and during expiration <EOS>
<SOS> this mode could be best termed as electronic extubation <EOS>
<SOS> the most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ari patients was their minute ventilation 17 8 1 85 l min in ari patients vs 7 3 3 1 l min in the postoperative patients <EOS>
<SOS> in the postoperative patients augmentation of ips from <NUM> to <NUM> mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume vt and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate rr compared with atc vtatc postop 463 78 ml rratc postop 16 4 min 1 vtips5 postop 505 79 ml rrips5 postop 15 4 min 1 vtips10 postop 562 86 ml rrips15 postop 14 4 min 1 vtips15 postop 660 <NUM> ml rrtps15 postop 12 4 min 1 whereas the augmentation of ips of <NUM> and <NUM> mbar in the ari patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in vt after switching from atc to ips vtatc ari 724 308 ml rratc ari 24 6 min 1 vtips5 ari 649 315 ml rrips 5 ari 27 8 min 1 vtips10 ari 653 353 ml rrips10 ari 25 8 min 1 even ips <NUM> was not able to reestablish vt at the values observed during atc vtips15 ari 680 312 ml <EOS>

<SOS> under atc wobadd was only 15 of wobadd under ips of <NUM> mbar <EOS>
<SOS> all but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation <EOS>
<SOS> these two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an fio2 0 5 <EOS>
<SOS> our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ari patients may be caused by the ett rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung <EOS>
<SOS> atc is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ett and real ventilatory dependence <EOS>
<SOS> the preoperative localization of pharmaco resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to conventional mri diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging hmr spectroscopy can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies <EOS>
<SOS> the technique and findings of hmr spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies <EOS>
<SOS> the findings indicate that chemical shift imaging csi investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery <EOS>
<SOS> this paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients <EOS>
<SOS> the different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease ptsd are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma <EOS>
<SOS> the utilisation of konzentrative bewegungstherapy kbt and creative therapy in our conflict and solution oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a potential space winnicott can be opened to the creative work with the patients <EOS>
<SOS> this paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of kbt in transforming the traumatic body flashbacks into narrative memory scripts by the use of symbolizing processes <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker relay intermedics and different pacing leads the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> 2 8 <NUM> years after implantation atrial and ventricular pulse width thresholds trs ms were determined at 0 5 1 0 and <NUM> v and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered <EOS>
<SOS> if trs was 1 50 ms at <NUM> v an amplitude of <NUM> v was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule if trs was 1 50 ms at <NUM> v then an amplitude of <NUM> v was chosen <EOS>
<SOS> two times the charge threshold 2x qrs two times the voltage threshold 2x urs and three times the pulse width threshold 3x trs were programmed as the safety margins for pacing <EOS>
<SOS> with every safety margin battery current irs µa was averaged from <NUM> telemetric readings in d00 mode with <NUM> bpm <EOS>
<SOS> ibat was significantly lower with 2x qrs as compared with 2x urs <MOB> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> µa p0 01 and as compared with 3x trs <MOB> <NUM> µa p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x qrs 112 <NUM> months as compared with 2x urs 106 9 p0 01 and as compared with 3x trs 108 8 p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> if current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude battery current is significantly lower at <NUM> v as compared with <NUM> v resulting in a mean reduction of <NUM> µa 4 9 p0 05 and an average gain in longevity of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> this applies to every safety margin tested <EOS>
<SOS> differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption <EOS>
<SOS> any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient giving informed consent <EOS>
<SOS> this prerequisite is based on the right to self determination <EOS>
<SOS> otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury <EOS>
<SOS> thus the way how a specific procedure is performed predominantly depends on the patient is will <EOS>
<SOS> the attending physician is duty is to find out this will which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved <EOS>
<SOS> before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient <EOS>
<SOS> he has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient is life <EOS>
<SOS> the physician has to find out weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient is fear and to increase his confidence <EOS>
<SOS> the main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation <EOS>
<SOS> one has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases a third party consent is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> this review of german neurology during the nazi era mentions first the significance of jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from germany represented <EOS>
<SOS> a brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of german neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles exemplified by the human experiments of g schaltenbrand <EOS>
<SOS> the spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence <EOS>
<SOS> a postal survey targeted at <NUM> firms in the metal and electronic working industry of northrhine westfalia was carried out by sozialforschungsstelle dortmund und institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement <EOS>
<SOS> as the results show firms in northrhine westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve <EOS>
<SOS> firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement <EOS>
<SOS> therefore partial retirement is created as a so called blocked model <EOS>
<SOS> from february <NUM> to may 1998 <NUM> patients had a cardioverter defibrillator icd implanted <EOS>

<SOS> 60 of patients had coronary artery disease and 31 dilative cardiomyopathy <EOS>
<SOS> ejection fraction was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 14 <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was in 57 of patients ventricular tachycardia in 43 ventricular fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> 298 patients had a single chamber cardioverter defibrillator implanted <NUM> patients a dual chamber cardioverter defibrillator <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in <NUM> patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted <EOS>

<SOS> over a period of <NUM> years <NUM> lead related complications occured in <NUM> patients 9 7 after a median of <NUM> months after implantation <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis was made by routine chest x ray in about 55 of lead related complications by clinical presentation inadequate therapy pain in 24 and by electrical parameters in 21 <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with an abdominal implantation site lead related complications occurred in 20 in contrast to 6 in patients with a pectoral implantation site <EOS>
<SOS> regarding patients with pectoral implantation site lead related complications were observed in 12 of patients with a dual chamber icd vs 4 with a single chamber icd p 0 05 due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual chamber icd <EOS>
<SOS> there were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual chamber icd <EOS>
<SOS> several new approaches are available for early defibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> one example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff <EOS>
<SOS> the recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician emt defibrillation in germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor manned ambulances or the experiences of the german multi center study <EOS>
<SOS> this analysis intends to contribute data to an emt defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous system <EOS>
<SOS> methods in a prospective study a emt defibrillation group dg was compared with a standard group basic life support by emts and defibrillation by emergency physicians sg and a control group emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with emts cg <EOS>
<SOS> in the dg semiautomatic defibrillators from laerdal heartstart 300 were used <EOS>
<SOS> successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the glasgow coma scale gcs the pittsburgh brain stem score pbss and pittsburgh cerebral cpc and overall performance categorie opc <EOS>
<SOS> results over <NUM> months <NUM> patients were included primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation vf <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the dg n 12 to the sg n 18 or to the cg n 13 <EOS>
<SOS> dg and sg did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long term prognosis primary successful 8 3 vs 38 9 definite successful 0 vs 27 8 <EOS>
<SOS> the primary survival rate in the dg was significantly lower than in the cg 8 3 vs 61 5 <EOS>
<SOS> in the long term survival rate there were no significant differences <EOS>
<SOS> in the dg significantly less patients received bystander cpr 8 3 than in the other groups 55 6 and 69 2 <EOS>
<SOS> neither the variable witnessed collapes nor bystander cpr had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study <EOS>
<SOS> the average response time for the first arriving rescue team was <NUM> <NUM> min without a significant difference between the groups <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions a comparison of this study with american european and german recommendations for emt defibrillation programms revealed some deviations <EOS>
<SOS> bystander cpr seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician <EOS>
<SOS> a benefit of emt defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our rendezvous system possibly because the time interval was less than <NUM> min 3 5 min <EOS>
<SOS> since the result is in accordance with the german multi center study a critical consideration of a emt defibrillation program seems to be necessary in rendezvous systems <EOS>

<SOS> reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards whereas current guidelines are being mentioned including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients <EOS>
<SOS> this is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56 year old male <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis as the patient could not remember any trauma <EOS>
<SOS> after performing mri a <NUM> x <NUM> mm signal free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was discharged soon after without any complaints <EOS>
<SOS> many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age dependent interval <EOS>
<SOS> they inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli <EOS>
<SOS> red cells platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes causing a lot of side effects <EOS>
<SOS> modern filtration and apheresis techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of 1x106 per unit <EOS>
<SOS> the best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage filtration <EOS>
<SOS> this is an effective method to prevent cytokine mediated and leucocyte mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions fnhtr to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte and histocompatibility antigens to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion e g <EOS>
<SOS> cytomegalovirus cmv and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there are references to reduce the postoperative infections the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the use of leucocyte depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established <EOS>
<SOS> some european countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes <EOS>
<SOS> the authors recommend the general leucocyte depletion of blood components considering the german medical law amg and cost benefit ratio <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients defensiveness <EOS>
<SOS> this study demonstrates on <NUM> psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client centered therapy and followed up <NUM> year after treatment that defensiveness measured with validity scales of personality inventories mmpi k fpi r and gießen test influences ratings scales cgi hama hamd brmes before and after therapy <EOS>
<SOS> patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow up <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales <EOS>
<SOS> inpatient client centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness <EOS>
<SOS> introduction because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact <EOS>
<SOS> there is a high demand on therapeutic modalities using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic <NUM> diseases <EOS>
<SOS> no data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture <EOS>
<SOS> aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain <EOS>
<SOS> we compared these <NUM> results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our <NUM> orthopaedic outpatient clinic <EOS>
<SOS> materials and results <NUM> patients with chronic pain for at least <NUM> months were observed <EOS>
<SOS> all three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores <EOS>
<SOS> best <NUM> results were gained with steroid injection n 26 66 pain reduction acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62 n 230 whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48 n 22 <EOS>
<SOS> sole mepivacain hcl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion according to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and <NUM> steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative <NUM> therapy in cases of sciatic pain <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising <NUM> orthopaedists <EOS>
<SOS> this paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities <EOS>
<SOS> to find answers a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all german psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> the results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> about half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies mostly including prospective randomized clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> these studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders substance abuse schizophrenic and affective disorders anxiety and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders <EOS>
<SOS> to improve psychotherapy research conditions further efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange financial support and the integration of institutions outside the universities <EOS>
<SOS> there is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria fetal heart rate abnormalities abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth <EOS>
<SOS> there is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia hellp syndrome renal failure or eclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> moreover blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth <EOS>
<SOS> antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension 170 110 mm hg to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress <EOS>
<SOS> oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress <EOS>
<SOS> increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow <EOS>
<SOS> controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> baker is cysts were treated operatively in <NUM> patients in the department of traumatology of the university of cologne from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography follow up <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were examinated before surgery sonography and x ray of the knee were performed <EOS>
<SOS> we differentiated between the congenital primary cyst 39 and the secondary form which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion 61 <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of baker is cyst <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion <EOS>
<SOS> patient is evaluation of operation result was excellent in <NUM> and good in <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> all knee joints had a full range of motion <EOS>
<SOS> there was only one case of a recurrent cyst <EOS>
<SOS> the primary form of baker is cyst has always to be extirpated according to our clinical experience <EOS>
<SOS> the extirpation of the secondary baker is cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in median avcuate ligament syndrome compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries <EOS>
<SOS> a lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways the symptoms vary considerably <EOS>
<SOS> we report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two vessel involvement <EOS>
<SOS> in such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit <EOS>
<SOS> usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient <EOS>
<SOS> bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow <EOS>
<SOS> the microscopic examination of giemsa stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique <EOS>
<SOS> however the expertise required is a major disadvantage <EOS>
<SOS> recently methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available <EOS>
<SOS> the use of an antigen capture assay for the detection of histidine rich protein 2 an antigen specific for plasmodium falciparum forms the basis of the parasight f becton dickinson and the ict malaria pf test ict diagnostics <EOS>
<SOS> parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by flow inc <EOS>
<SOS> these currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> a decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia <EOS>
<SOS> however false negative <NUM> results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities <EOS>
<SOS> purpose discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> there is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb <EOS>
<SOS> methods between <NUM> and 1996 <NUM> patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization including <NUM> cases of deep revascularization <NUM> supra genicular femoro popliteal bypasses <NUM> infra genicular femoro popliteal bypasses and <NUM> femoro crural bypasses <EOS>
<SOS> mean patient age was <NUM> <NUM> years <NUM> patients were female and <NUM> were male <EOS>
<SOS> there was a 38 rate 166 436 of reoperation <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation including the methods of weber and moberg <EOS>
<SOS> results we found eleven patients 4 with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation <EOS>
<SOS> after the reoperation <NUM> patients 33 had nerve lesions <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15 of our patients on discharge from hospital <EOS>
<SOS> they had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions <EOS>
<SOS> classic and hiv associated kaposi is sarcoma ks are predominantly found in male caucasians <EOS>
<SOS> it is unclear why ks is so rare in women <EOS>
<SOS> at the department of dermatology university of frankfurt epidemic ks was diagnosed in 299 751 40 male and 5 72 18 female hiv infected patients <EOS>
<SOS> to detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency hormonal disturbances abnormalities in clinical course or sexual practices data of eight women with ks five hiv three hiv were compared <EOS>
<SOS> in hiv women ks is more aggressive than in hiv women and more aggressive than in hiv men <EOS>
<SOS> early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found <EOS>
<SOS> compared to hiv women with ks hiv women are generally younger mean age <NUM> vs <NUM> years and significantly immunodeficient reduced absolute cd4 cell count and cd4 cd8 ratio <EOS>
<SOS> all women with ks investigated for sexual hormones 7 8 showed abnormalities 7 7 had low oestrogens 4 6 low lh and 3 5 low progesterone <EOS>
<SOS> controls n 11 hiv without ks showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones but the difference was not significant <EOS>
<SOS> although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens drug abuse marasmus menopause must be considered the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in hiv and hiv women with ks <EOS>
<SOS> there was no correlation between sexual practices anal or oral faecal contacts and the manifestation or aggressiveness of ks <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular lv systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement avr due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of lv hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired lv systolic function prior to surgery <EOS>
<SOS> 74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis 29 female <NUM> male mean age <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> years were divided into <NUM> groups according to lv ejection fraction ef group <NUM> with ef 50 n 40 group <NUM> with ef 50 n 34 <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore patients were differentiated into a group a without n 53 and a group b with aortic regurgitation ii ° n 21 <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and <NUM> month after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> there was a significant decrease of lv enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following avr in group <NUM> and group b <EOS>
<SOS> patients with preoperatively lower ef group 2 showed an increase in lv ejection fraction from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 10 before avr to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 11 after avr p 0 001 whereas patients with preoperative normal ef group 1 showed a significant decrease in ef from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 8 to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 10 p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> also patients with combined aortic valve disease before avr had an increase of ef after surgery from <NUM> plusmn 14 to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 14 p 0 03 <EOS>
<SOS> there were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and lv posterior wall thickness in group <NUM> and group a whereas a significant decrease of lv anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group b <EOS>
<SOS> improvement of the nyha functional class could be demonstrated in group <NUM> from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> before to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> after avr as well as in group b from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> before to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion patients with impaired lv function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after avr while patients with normal lv function presented a slight decrease of ef <EOS>
<SOS> there was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status <EOS>
<SOS> cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently irreversible cellular damage e g during myocardial infarction causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue <EOS>
<SOS> it is therefore not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest <EOS>
<SOS> in other species such as mice rats and dogs the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast satellite cell and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods <EOS>
<SOS> repeatedly it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast grafthost connections have not as yet been convincingly demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> hypothetically cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling carrier for recombinant proteins growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility <EOS>
<SOS> however clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells and thus of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells remains to be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> concomitant with advances in medicine involving the development and use of antibiotics immunosuppressive drugs organ stem cell transplantation and pre existing illnesses such as aids the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically <EOS>
<SOS> these factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease <EOS>
<SOS> purpose we evaluated the speed of sound sos and broadband ultrasound attenuation bua at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age related changes in ultrasound values in normal women <EOS>
<SOS> materials and methods bua and sos were measured in <NUM> women using the achilles densitometer lunar madison ohio <EOS>
<SOS> from the bua and sos values the bua sos index stiffness index is calculated <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> female patients with osteoporosis aged 43 85 years and <NUM> healthy women aged 20 80 years <EOS>
<SOS> results ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group <EOS>
<SOS> the z score compared with young normals was higher for the bua sos index 3 1 than for bua 2 5 and sos 3 0 <EOS>
<SOS> at a bua sos index of <NUM> the sensitivity was <NUM> and the specificity was <NUM> for patients with osteoporotic fractures <EOS>
<SOS> we found a significant decline with age in sos r 0 55 bua r 0 50 and bua sos index r 0 57 <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis <EOS>
<SOS> a treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly <EOS>
<SOS> because of demographic development and the progress of medicine the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing <EOS>
<SOS> in practice we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or for procedures that can wait with the consent of legitimate family members <EOS>
<SOS> an initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically <EOS>
<SOS> a number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events life conditions and depression <EOS>
<SOS> however there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype <EOS>
<SOS> the present study examines the significance of the patients life events life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months <EOS>
<SOS> patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode <EOS>
<SOS> the results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in patients <EOS>
<SOS> relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse <EOS>
<SOS> depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation <EOS>
<SOS> since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997 there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia <EOS>
<SOS> besides fat redistribution has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanism of these changes remains unclear <EOS>
<SOS> for therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried <EOS>
<SOS> 29 of our <NUM> patients developed lipodystrophy <EOS>
<SOS> 27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor 17 patients with indinavir <NUM> of the patients had never received protease inhibitors <EOS>
<SOS> background the low vision enhancement system lvesr is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance <EOS>
<SOS> dna cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the who classification <EOS>
<SOS> in this study <NUM> tumour specimens of <NUM> patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases the histological type and who grade and the ki 67 mib1 labeling index were determined <EOS>
<SOS> dna cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on feulgen stained preparations and the following parameters were calculated stemline ploidy 5c exceeding rate and 2c deviation index <EOS>
<SOS> there is a world wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of parkinson is disease pd based on substantial progress in basic sciences <EOS>
<SOS> a model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in pd <EOS>
<SOS> the internal globus pallidus gpi is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus nst <EOS>
<SOS> lesioning of these targets has been successful in mptp damaged primates <EOS>
<SOS> there is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics <EOS>
<SOS> pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting <EOS>
<SOS> the first technic is used for treatment of rigidity hypokinesia and dyskinesias the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor <EOS>
<SOS> dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells this method however carries immunological and ethical problems <EOS>
<SOS> the continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic it is highly adaptable to the patient is need and carries a low morbidity profile <EOS>
<SOS> thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor <EOS>
<SOS> the stimulation of nst and gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on off phenomena <EOS>
<SOS> animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells <EOS>
<SOS> in summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best combination treatment s for the future <EOS>
<SOS> concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern <EOS>
<SOS> even though the need for effective documentation i e adequate in content availability feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis is not a question tasks and aims for example quality of patient care deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed <EOS>
<SOS> the medtronic thera thera i and kappa 400 pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the dd r mode to the ddir mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia <EOS>
<SOS> to accomplish this the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate mar which is a weighted index of the atrial rate <EOS>
<SOS> once the mar is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode <EOS>
<SOS> because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias including those with varying amplitudes <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the algorithm provides a long pvarp and a rate adaptive ra av interval <EOS>
<SOS> these not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching <EOS>
<SOS> in order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm the thera i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date time duration and rate of the mode switch episodes <EOS>
<SOS> additionally more detailed beat to beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes <EOS>
<SOS> there is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> for dermatological patients such data are not available <EOS>
<SOS> in early spring <NUM> we studied the psychological changes in <NUM> hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the ruhr university bochum <EOS>
<SOS> we used the german version of the internationally accepted hospital anxiety and depression scale <EOS>
<SOS> we found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25 9 and 31 <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological cardiological or neurological patient populations <EOS>
<SOS> surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases <EOS>
<SOS> these results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> in an analysis of 3 838 restrained car drivers the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under <NUM> in <NUM> to over <NUM> in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> these injuries occurred mainly in the case of head on or multiple collisions <EOS>
<SOS> letters were sent to 1 136 of the injured persons and of the <NUM> patients who returned the questionnaires <NUM> 88 were still suffering from their symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> it was a question of pain 74 tension 6 and stiffness 5 in the head 27 neck 55 and shoulder 8 area <EOS>
<SOS> the duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor <EOS>
<SOS> in order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis treatment protocols duration and type of complaints <EOS>
<SOS> large b cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non hodgkin lymphomas <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> they are characterised by an aggressive clinical course <EOS>
<SOS> these lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to primary nodal a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common <EOS>
<SOS> the neoplastic cells even within one given case show a broad morphological spectrum <EOS>
<SOS> several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large b cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group <EOS>
<SOS> this fact has been taken into account by the new who classification of malignant lymphomas <EOS>
<SOS> there are two groups identified that of the variants and that of the subtypes <EOS>
<SOS> the various variants centroblastic immunoblastic anaplastic t cell histiocyte rich correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical immunophenotypical and genetic findings <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the primary mediastinal the intravascular the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities <EOS>
<SOS> a number of recently described large cell lymphoma types i e plasmablastic alk positive and primary gastric are included in the classification their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion <EOS>
<SOS> in the presented study knee joint proprioception of <NUM> patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> in a control group the proprioception of <NUM> healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined <EOS>
<SOS> we tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test <EOS>
<SOS> additionally all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage <EOS>
<SOS> the patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability 13 2 <NUM> ° <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ° compared to the control group 7 8 <NUM> ° <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ° <EOS>

<SOS> atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men <EOS>
<SOS> it is associated with a two fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers <EOS>
<SOS> the relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies <EOS>
<SOS> ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> it has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus <EOS>
<SOS> these ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> most often these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins <EOS>
<SOS> a challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study <EOS>
<SOS> to sidestep the need of mapping pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions <EOS>
<SOS> in patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate <EOS>
<SOS> several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> currently attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous catheter based approaches <EOS>
<SOS> though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved <EOS>
<SOS> using a time budget method in a <NUM> year longitudinal study with a control group design substantial reductions in the engagement of non obligatory instrumental social and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients <EOS>
<SOS> controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters the dementia specific reduction was about 1 5 hours compared to a non psychiatric control group <EOS>
<SOS> these clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia <EOS>
<SOS> time budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness <EOS>
<SOS> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm is a disease with different etiological morphological functional clinical and therapeutic aspects <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations indicate that hcm is considerably widespread in the population 1 500 <EOS>
<SOS> the causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities mutations <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the clinical aspect the complaints and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management <EOS>
<SOS> atrial fibrillation is in 20 50 the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting cabg and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the effect of blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias sva was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial <EOS>
<SOS> 200 patients after cabg were randomized in a drug and control group average age <NUM> years <NUM> male <NUM> female <EOS>
<SOS> patients of the drug group n 100 were treated with metoprolol 1mg kg bw beginning on day one after operation whereas patients of the control group n 100 received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton <EOS>
<SOS> ecg blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction 30 sa and av block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age sex ejection fraction previous medication number and type of bypass grafts cardiopulmonary bypass time and perioperative ischemic events <EOS>
<SOS> however a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups <NUM> patients of the therapy group 4 in contrast to <NUM> patients of the control 37 developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period p<MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by <NUM> days control group <NUM> <NUM> days drug group <NUM> <NUM> days which was statistically significant p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> all patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm whereas <NUM> patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> the difference was statistically significant as well p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> neither typical side effects of metoprolol nor av blocks bradycardia f60 min or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed <EOS>
<SOS> the conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol day after coronary artery bypass surgery which can reduce the incidence of sva as well as the hospital stay statistically significant <EOS>

<SOS> angiotensine ii is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor <EOS>
<SOS> ace inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the who guidelines <EOS>
<SOS> the experiences concerning the use of ace inhibitors in pediatric patients are <NUM> limited <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of side effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis <EOS>
<SOS> evoked potentials ep are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co operation <EOS>
<SOS> different modalities of short latency ep can be applied to evaluate sensory auditory and visual systems <EOS>

<SOS> paclitaxel a potent anti tumor agent shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules <EOS>
<SOS> these cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation migration and signal transduction <EOS>
<SOS> it is highly lipophilic which promotes a rapid cellular uptake and has a long lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton <EOS>
<SOS> this makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis <EOS>
<SOS> in this article results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented <EOS>
<SOS> cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of <MOB>µmol l even after a short 20 min single dose application <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison of an active semi active and passive delivery system porous balloon microporous balloon and double balloon favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments <EOS>
<SOS> tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel induced vessel wall alterations <EOS>
<SOS> in the rabbit model locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size in the pig model however after stenting this inhibition was not significant <EOS>
<SOS> both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments <EOS>
<SOS> atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases with a still increasing incidence <EOS>
<SOS> although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood a variety of triggering factors are known <EOS>
<SOS> the following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2 year old boy in whom both ige mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions <EOS>
<SOS> this demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be <EOS>
<SOS> identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes <EOS>
<SOS> a model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an imaginary self consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities <EOS>
<SOS> the imaginary self stabilizes irritating self deficiencies thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation <EOS>
<SOS> biomaterials are defined as non living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems <EOS>
<SOS> especially in the field of urology biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion urinary incontinence erectile dysfunction and as cosmetic prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> biomaterial tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial its degradation and the resulting protein denaturation <EOS>
<SOS> general requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic mutagenic toxic and allergic reactions <EOS>
<SOS> this ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation <EOS>
<SOS> continuous modification of known materials inauguration of new materials as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come <EOS>
<SOS> hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper under the premise that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method <EOS>
<SOS> it is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient <EOS>
<SOS> first a series of diagnostic structural motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> second the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication <EOS>
<SOS> as cohesion according to group treatment outcome research results has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance in the context of group psychotherapy the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits <EOS>

<SOS> the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead in the worst case to graft loss <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and january 1997 we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in <NUM> female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria 10 wc per microscope field x40 and significant bacteriuria 105 ml combined with vaginal contamination plenty of squamous epithelial cells mixed bacterial growth <EOS>
<SOS> results in <NUM> 17 31 diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization in <NUM> 8 31 urinary tract infection could be excluded and in <NUM> 6 31 bladder colonization without pyuria was found <EOS>
<SOS> thus <NUM> of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials <EOS>
<SOS> after single dose antibiotic therapy with <NUM> mg ciprofloxacin given immediately after catheterization no infectious complications occurred <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple safe and compared to suprapubic aspiration barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non conclusive voided urine samples <EOS>
<SOS> most people with the metabolic syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions mostly myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> type 2 diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia hypertension and obesity <EOS>
<SOS> this is referred to as metabolic syndrome and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy <EOS>
<SOS> from a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with the metabolic syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state involving increased plasmatic coagulation diminished fibrinolysis decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity diabetic thrombocytopathy <EOS>
<SOS> some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk e g <EOS>
<SOS> fibrinogen pai 1 platelets but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs decreased success of acute reduced fibrinolytic response no reflow phenomenon and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency ptca cabg in diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose insulin potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non diabetics <EOS>
<SOS> on the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome including antihypertensive antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures early secondary prevention <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain progressive sliding and in up to <NUM> of the patients with progressive dislocation from radicular malfunction <EOS>
<SOS> the posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> with the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible with an acceptable neurological risk <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a concept of treatment is suggested which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the extent of the slip reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one two or three stages <EOS>
<SOS> an anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade i dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> in grade ii v a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> objectives this study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia isb and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the original method described by winnie bears some rare but life threatening complications inadvertent subarachnoid or intra arterial injection pneumothorax <EOS>
<SOS> objectives due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low flow anaesthetic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low flow and minimal flow desflurane anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> methods one hundred six asa status i ii patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high flow phase fresh gas flow and fresh gas desflurane concentration <EOS>
<SOS> the median age height body weight and constitution of the groups was comparable <EOS>
<SOS> after an initial high flow phase using <NUM> l min the fresh gas flow was reduced to <NUM> l min minimal flow anaesthesia or <NUM> l min low flow anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60 to 70 <EOS>
<SOS> using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3 4 to 8 7 i e between <NUM> and <NUM> mac <EOS>
<SOS> inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side stream technique and recorded on line <EOS>
<SOS> venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and <NUM> min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin cohb concentration <EOS>
<SOS> results in the 10 to 15 min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of <NUM> l min was used the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90 95 of the fresh gas concentration <EOS>
<SOS> in low flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting whereas in minimal flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1 to 2 the quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration q ci cf ranges between <NUM> and <NUM> in minimal flow and between <NUM> and <NUM> in low flow anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> if use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5 in <NUM> min although the flow was kept constant at <NUM> l min <EOS>
<SOS> compared with its value prior to induction 2 13 1 05 the cohb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0 7 during the 1st hour of minimal flow anaesthesia 1 42 1 01 <EOS>
<SOS> in no case was a cohb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane resulting in especially low individual uptake and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> even in minimal flow anaesthesia the duration of the initial high flow phase can be shortened to min <EOS>
<SOS> if the flow is reduced to <NUM> l min the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting <EOS>
<SOS> in minimal flow anaesthesia however with flow reduction to <NUM> l min the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1 2 higher than the inspired nominal value <EOS>
<SOS> due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about <NUM> ml min even at a flow of <NUM> l min <EOS>
<SOS> the large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low flow conditions together with the very low individual uptake results in a time constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations <EOS>
<SOS> the short time constant of low flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration <EOS>
<SOS> if all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime there is no evidence that low flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca <EOS>
<SOS> arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> specific complications are rarely documented in literature <EOS>
<SOS> the perforation of an arterial port a cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents such as vomiting sickness or gastritis and duodenitis gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series <EOS>
<SOS> based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> background coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations projected in different parts of the body <EOS>
<SOS> patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> these symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception <EOS>
<SOS> coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases e g schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> however in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases e g intracranial tumors or infections <EOS>
<SOS> therefore accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important <EOS>
<SOS> in late stages coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their bizarre character <EOS>
<SOS> in early stages however patients often complain of intractable unlocalizable burning pain <EOS>

<SOS> studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment <EOS>
<SOS> two approaches one oriented toward the subject is experience of the home environment another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual is favorite place were employed <EOS>
<SOS> is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive biographical and spatial dimensions of the living environment <EOS>
<SOS> similarities were found in the experience of emotional social and behavioral dimensions of one is home <EOS>
<SOS> competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped <EOS>
<SOS> the environment oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density <EOS>
<SOS> finally an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person and environment oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment <EOS>
<SOS> even though the subjective experience of one is home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person is daily life <EOS>
<SOS> the main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation posterior fixation suture for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia <EOS>

<SOS> tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass <EOS>
<SOS> the initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> recurrences of tumor after <NUM> and then <NUM> years were excised <EOS>
<SOS> histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma <EOS>

<SOS> there were <NUM> reluxations 5 because of a new accident mostly after putti platt procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the average modified constant score was <NUM> <MOB> points maximum 85 <EOS>
<SOS> 29 patients 27 had less than <NUM> points mostly because of pain and restriction of function and were evaluated as poor <EOS>
<SOS> lesions of rotator cuff long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome <EOS>
<SOS> operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results <EOS>
<SOS> anatomic reconstruction of the labrum ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results <EOS>

<SOS> molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses hpv types <NUM> and <NUM> are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix <EOS>
<SOS> this statement is also true albeit with reservations as yet of other so called high risk hpv types such as hpv 31 33 35 39 45 51 52 <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> around 500 00 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year and 1 4 of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri <EOS>
<SOS> this knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses however <EOS>
<SOS> this is mainly because infection with genital hpv types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> in this review therefore the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with hpv <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the molecular biological data on hpv as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the significance of hpv for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 43 year old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> a prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after <NUM> minutes <EOS>
<SOS> it was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by <NUM> attemps of defibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> a cardiologist was informed with radio signal <EOS>
<SOS> percutaneous cardiopulmonary support pcps was implanted in the emergency department after <NUM> minutes of cardiac arrest <EOS>
<SOS> after stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pcps 4 5 l min it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory <EOS>

<SOS> after successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> by use of intra aortic balloon pump iabp the flow rate of pcps was reduced every two hours <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> hours of support pcps was explaned <EOS>
<SOS> iabp was needed for three days <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks <EOS>
<SOS> by using pcps it is possible to stabilize the patient is hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice <EOS>

<SOS> in <NUM> cases 53 reconstruction was performed primarily in <NUM> cases 40 secondarily <EOS>
<SOS> free or pedicled soft tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26 of the defects <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand small isolated defects of the orbital roof 7 were left without any reconstructive procedure <EOS>
<SOS> contrary to the iliac bone grafts the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative infections appeared in two cases loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts <EOS>
<SOS> the selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects <EOS>

<SOS> we report an 18 year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism phpt and normal intact parathyroid hormone ipth serum levels <EOS>
<SOS> the reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay pth irma <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated ipth level <EOS>
<SOS> viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide <EOS>
<SOS> more than <NUM> million chronic hbsag carriers and chronic hcv carriers exist respectively <EOS>
<SOS> high endemic areas of viral hepatitis are asia africa latin america and the near middle and far east <EOS>
<SOS> viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers <EOS>
<SOS> today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type a to type e g based on immunological and molecular assays <EOS>
<SOS> while enterally transmitted hepatitis type a and type e only induce acute and rare fulminant disease hepatitis type b c and d often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer hcc <EOS>
<SOS> this review focusses on viral hepatitis related surgical problems including liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> hypertensive diseases in pregnancy hdp are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality <EOS>
<SOS> however chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> apart from a familial predisposition mutations of various genes may also be responsible among these apc resistance is of particular clinical significance <EOS>
<SOS> the insufficient endovascular invasion of trophoblast in the spiral aterioles is still considered to represent the pathogenetic basis of preeclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> increased lipid oxidation deported membrane components of syncytiotrophoblasts and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes <EOS>
<SOS> the result is an endothelial imbalance between vasoconstrictory aggregating and vasodilatatory antiaggregating compounds <EOS>
<SOS> the results of studies on the relevance of no synthase are controversial <EOS>
<SOS> currently neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain preventative measures to avoid the disease are available <EOS>
<SOS> intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe hdp <EOS>
<SOS> the obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby <EOS>

<SOS> the goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution the gerontopsychiatric center gc a combination of a home based outpatient service a day hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures as experts of the government of the frg have been demanding for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> based on data of cross sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas the city of bielefeld without gc control region and the district of gütersloh with gc are compared and analyzed whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system subsystem a the system of general medical treatment subsystem b or within the elderly care system subsystem c occurred <EOS>
<SOS> concerning subsystem a the results are that the gc has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra to extramural structures without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities <EOS>
<SOS> the home based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder <EOS>
<SOS> these patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self care deficits within one year effects of the gc on subsystem b were evident soon after its establishment for example by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with gc in which hospitals two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis icd 9 are treated <EOS>
<SOS> an effect of the gc on subsystem c is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without gc <EOS>
<SOS> in the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system <EOS>
<SOS> one approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research <EOS>
<SOS> while the phenomenon of stress induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses <EOS>
<SOS> within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort <EOS>
<SOS> using a public speaking paradigm we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of cd8 and cd56 cells in peripheral blood <EOS>
<SOS> moreover when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects <EOS>
<SOS> however high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort <EOS>
<SOS> the data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy <EOS>

<SOS> he had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy <NUM> years earlier following <NUM> mg thiopentone <NUM> mg suxamethonium and up to <NUM> vol halothane for <NUM> min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia mh were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> following oral premedication with <NUM> mg flunitrazepam at <NUM> a m anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at <NUM> a m followed by <NUM> mg fentanyl <NUM> mg thiopentone and <NUM> mg suxamethonium <EOS>
<SOS> endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily 9 and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed <EOS>
<SOS> enflurane 1 5 for <NUM> min 1 0 for <NUM> min and 0 8 until the diagnosis of mh was suspected was given in 33 o2 66 n2o <EOS>
<SOS> seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10 min and <NUM> l min respectively to 20 min and <NUM> l min <EOS>
<SOS> attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of <NUM> mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of a high fresh gas flow of <NUM> l min and assisted manual ventilation the fio2 started to fall from <NUM> to <NUM> at <NUM> a m <EOS>
<SOS> the o2 n2o ratio was changed to <NUM> <NUM> 1 but the fio2 remained at <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> mh was suspected enflurane was discontinued and an arterial blood gas analysis was done table 2 <EOS>
<SOS> when marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found dantrolene <NUM> mg kg was given the operation was terminated and the patient is trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for <NUM> h vital signs were stable table 3 and no further complications were observed <EOS>
<SOS> the patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> months later a muscle biopsy was done according to the european mh protocol 5 and the patient was found to be mheh <EOS>
<SOS> in this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered table 1 <EOS>
<SOS> firstly hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with <NUM> to <NUM> l min which is within the range of <NUM> <NUM> mg kg min <EOS>
<SOS> secondly we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate within <NUM> <NUM> beats min his fingertips and skin were well perfused his body temperature was <NUM> <NUM> °c and there was no sign of muscle rigidity <EOS>
<SOS> thirdly a defect of the co2 adsorber as well as co2 admixture to the n2o and o2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia <EOS>
<SOS> we use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers 11 <EOS>
<SOS> a postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the o2 n2o supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus <EOS>
<SOS> a malfunction of both co2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than <NUM> h anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism <EOS>
<SOS> a thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid pulmonary endocrine or circulatory reason for our intra and postoperative findings <EOS>
<SOS> iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than <NUM> h table 2 <EOS>
<SOS> the most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of mh <EOS>
<SOS> introduction avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery op cab off pump coronary artery bypass surgery for aortocoronary bypass grafting acbg is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> with the development of new mechanical stabilization devices the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable <EOS>
<SOS> especially high risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided <EOS>
<SOS> although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus nph alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease <EOS>
<SOS> a wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing apathy emotional indifference anosognosia memory and attentional impairment <EOS>
<SOS> a number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia dysgraphia acalculia apraxia can also frequently be found <EOS>
<SOS> some emphasis is put on the work of j de mol brussels which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in nph patients <EOS>
<SOS> the methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment <EOS>
<SOS> concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in nph various hypotheses have been formulated but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly diffuse in nature nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions <EOS>
<SOS> recommendations for future research strategies are formulated <EOS>
<SOS> up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia pedophilia sadism and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists in the germanspeaking countries <EOS>
<SOS> in this report we describe <NUM> patients which were treated with the lhrh agonist leuprolide acetate in a period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection ejaculation masturbation sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies <EOS>
<SOS> one patient died from suicide <EOS>
<SOS> in combination with other treatments lhrh agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects <EOS>
<SOS> aim of the study to investigate the long term effect of tnfr55 igg1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous dmard treatments <EOS>
<SOS> methods between <NUM> and <NUM> we recruited <NUM> patients for two double blind placebo controlled multicenter trials <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were treated for 2 30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 tnf receptors linked to a human igg1 fc <EOS>
<SOS> the dose range was <MOB>mg month given i v <EOS>
<SOS> with cumulative doses from <MOB>mg <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were followed up prospectively for 24 36 months after initiation of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluations included a <NUM> swollen and tender joint count esr crp rf ana ena and safety parameters at <NUM> month intervals <EOS>
<SOS> in addition pharmacokinetics tnf and anti tnfr55 igg1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection <EOS>
<SOS> results data from <NUM> patients are available representing an experience of more than <NUM> patient years <NUM> <NUM> patients are still being treated <EOS>
<SOS> predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol <EOS>
<SOS> six patients died <NUM> 1 during treatment <NUM> in the post treatment follow up <EOS>
<SOS> all deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post surgery septic arthritis <NUM> months after the last dosing during vacation in another country <EOS>
<SOS> anti tnfr55 igg1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half time <EOS>
<SOS> shifts in the tnfr55 igg1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy <EOS>
<SOS> a lupus nephritis occurred <NUM> months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive ra ana and dsdns positive already before tnfr55 igg1 initiation <EOS>
<SOS> continued treatment for <NUM> years in <NUM> patients resulted in an 81 reduction in swollen joint count less morning stiffness less pain and a reduction in steroids <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion treatment with tnfr55 igg1 is safe and efficacious over the long term in patients with severe refractory ra <EOS>
<SOS> for both vfr and as ifr flight visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot <EOS>
<SOS> the new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods <EOS>
<SOS> can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes <EOS>
<SOS> the valid regulations for medical standards of pilots as well as the future international regulations such as jar and icao are explained in this respect <EOS>
<SOS> a report is given on the work of the advisory board of the german federal government air traffic authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome and recommendations are expressed <EOS>
<SOS> concerning the legal situation and clinical experience advice for pilots aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given <EOS>
<SOS> persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders especially hypospadias <EOS>
<SOS> inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency is responsible for this syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> a complex case of penile scrotal hypospadia hypoplastic prostate gland testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the official german guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt now called robert koch institut twelve years ago <EOS>
<SOS> the recently published official guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc are categorized according to scientific evidence <EOS>
<SOS> the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official german guidelines <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia <EOS>
<SOS> at present the importation into germany of life threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and ebola is unlikely but cannot be ruled out <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation <EOS>
<SOS> in germany marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy <EOS>
<SOS> a federal framework is missing <EOS>
<SOS> a concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle centre long term open 12 months clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations fumaderm initial and fumaderm <EOS>
<SOS> the antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear with a mean reduction of 76 in pasi <EOS>
<SOS> adverse events in were noted in 62 of the patients mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints <EOS>
<SOS> these were dose dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study <EOS>
<SOS> no severe adverse events occurred <EOS>
<SOS> we believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long term application <EOS>
<SOS> background because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment <EOS>
<SOS> the eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions <EOS>
<SOS> swelling often oedematous is a frequent symptom <EOS>
<SOS> this publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes <EOS>
<SOS> the subjective complaints of the patient charts pain pruritus are shown to be important criteria for orientation <EOS>
<SOS> special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling <EOS>
<SOS> a 74 year old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia <EOS>
<SOS> additional retrosternal masses were proved <EOS>
<SOS> progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen <EOS>
<SOS> no germs could be identified <EOS>
<SOS> bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings <EOS>
<SOS> his general health became worse and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of wandering pneumonia with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland <EOS>
<SOS> general manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow <EOS>
<SOS> the unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction <EOS>
<SOS> the difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms <EOS>
<SOS> therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of ct mr and angiography is very important <EOS>
<SOS> definition of the problem is it the brain that makes a human being a person <EOS>
<SOS> this anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research and there are severe ethical consequences anew if the appropriate anthropological answer is yes then all invasive research would be problematic because one would touch the basis of human essence <EOS>
<SOS> the problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question dualism and monism have opposing concepts <EOS>
<SOS> arguments this paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as res as things <EOS>
<SOS> the explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms <EOS>
<SOS> a third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the hebrew bible <EOS>
<SOS> it does assume the category thing while speaking about humans it presumes the category aspect <EOS>
<SOS> there is no hebrew word for mind in contrast to body or vice versa <EOS>
<SOS> the biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion here the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality <EOS>
<SOS> invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject <EOS>
<SOS> introduction in recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation <EOS>
<SOS> while the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis vip <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia which resolved completely after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the blockade of the plexus was performed correctly failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the vip which might occur despite correct technique and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the vip is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet <EOS>
<SOS> the risk of a pneumothorax is about <NUM> to 0 7 <EOS>
<SOS> the routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine <EOS>
<SOS> new trends in perinatal medicine aiming at more individual and self determined pregnancy and delivery are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy early detection of fetal viability intrauterine localization of the pregnancy exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy later in pregnancy confirmation of appropriate fetal growth position and localization of placenta site <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the development of close mother child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact <EOS>
<SOS> these aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child <EOS>
<SOS> for routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children sonography voiding cystogram iv pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed <EOS>
<SOS> however the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we reviewed the records of <NUM> children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> children the ureter was visualized by iv pyelogram voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in <NUM> children before pyeloplasty in the or <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique <EOS>
<SOS> in the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> hence we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> spontaneous remission of the tumour which has now been maintained for over <NUM> years the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat storing giant cells and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> in children with horseshoe kidneys wilms tumors can be observed <NUM> to 8 times more often <EOS>
<SOS> wilms tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue <EOS>
<SOS> we report about a 28 month old girl with an unusual wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications <EOS>
<SOS> the radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross section imagings <EOS>
<SOS> both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid wilms tumor <EOS>
<SOS> gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing <EOS>
<SOS> external gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo <EOS>
<SOS> gene transfer is a promising new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade <EOS>
<SOS> biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved <EOS>
<SOS> for the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite element models fem for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading <EOS>
<SOS> explanted human mandibles n 5 were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading <EOS>
<SOS> fem analysis based on a computed tomograph ct was performed and the results were matched with the test data <EOS>
<SOS> our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables <EOS>
<SOS> at all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile the minimum principal strain was compressive and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force <EOS>
<SOS> ct based fem analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results <EOS>
<SOS> hence fem analysis is a non invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning <EOS>
<SOS> acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis <EOS>
<SOS> 70 of affected patients exhibit mental retardation <EOS>
<SOS> inheritance occurs in an autosomal dominant pattern <EOS>
<SOS> the genetic defect is not known <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non resectable cancers the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate <EOS>
<SOS> even in curatively resected carcinomas a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent <EOS>
<SOS> based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than <NUM> gy is recommended resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone <EOS>
<SOS> the use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> in adjuvant and in primary treatment local tumor contol was improved <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> with palliative intent pain relief was obtained rapidly in over <NUM> of patients and led to improved patient performance <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of the high distant metastases rate even in curatively resected carcinomas the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body <EOS>
<SOS> they can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types <EOS>
<SOS> the way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region <EOS>
<SOS> these compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx the oropharynx and the hypopharynx <EOS>
<SOS> most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas other histologic types are depicted less frequently <EOS>
<SOS> the histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> the undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor <EOS>
<SOS> the malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments <EOS>
<SOS> beside these tumors malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated <EOS>
<SOS> while there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described <EOS>
<SOS> we report on two patients with per and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw dhs and a dynamic condylar screw dcs which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case <EOS>
<SOS> we blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement <EOS>
<SOS> after discussing various operative procedures we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications <EOS>
<SOS> cleft lip and palates clp are caused by a variety of factors <EOS>
<SOS> ionizing radiation is only one of these factors <EOS>
<SOS> the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at chernobyl on april 26 1986 and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in germany <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in west berlin a significant increase of trisomy 21 cases was reported in births <NUM> months after the chernobyl reactor accident <EOS>
<SOS> in our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of clp newborns in the former german democratic republic gdr <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the federal republic of germany an ongoing malformation register for clp newborns had existed in the former gdr since <NUM> july <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies <EOS>
<SOS> population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former gdr <EOS>
<SOS> during a 10 year period from <NUM> to 1989 the average number of clp newborns in the gdr was <NUM> per 1 00 live births <EOS>
<SOS> a significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983 <NUM> und <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to the mean rate in the period from <NUM> until 1986 <NUM> demonstrated an increase of 9 4 <EOS>
<SOS> regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of schwerin rostock and neubrandenburg where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium 137 und strontium 90 than in other districts <EOS>
<SOS> owing to the comprehensive malformation register for clp patients in the gdr this is the first study for germany analyzing the clp rate before and after the fallout in chernobyl <EOS>
<SOS> the results support the allegation of the influence of radiation induced increase of clp newborns after the chernobyl reactor accident <EOS>
<SOS> the median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5 7 months it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage iv disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> in the department of dermatology benjamin franklin university medical centre at the free university of berlin <NUM> patients with were diagnosed as having stage iv melanoma and enrolled in a computer based registry between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and <NUM> patients underwent surgery and or radiation therapy <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> patients who received both systemic and local therapy <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand <NUM> patients received no treatment <EOS>
<SOS> twenty two patients were identified survived longer than <NUM> months median survival time <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> none of the patients who had received no treatment survived for <NUM> years or longer <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included <NUM> who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and or radiation while <NUM> had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3 only local treatment <EOS>
<SOS> twelve of the <NUM> patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation <EOS>
<SOS> active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients <EOS>
<SOS> background the use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> a significant rebound of thrombin generation within <NUM> to <NUM> hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported <EOS>
<SOS> this time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period <EOS>
<SOS> it has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly <EOS>
<SOS> however it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound <EOS>
<SOS> the use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers <EOS>
<SOS> the actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> practical difficulties are emphasized in particular the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research the most suitable breeds and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results <EOS>
<SOS> laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years table 1 34 <EOS>
<SOS> laparoscopic pelvic and para aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of primarily operable tumours paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy <EOS>
<SOS> if laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> in addition laparoscopic procedures even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix can mean conservation of the patient is fertility <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient is condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable <EOS>
<SOS> in addition in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients n 20 was compared to methadone maintained subjects n 20 in a randomized comparison trial <EOS>
<SOS> sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a <NUM> week study period <EOS>
<SOS> a trend p 0 06 could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of <NUM> mg oral applicable methadone racemat of l and d methadone in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7 3 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets <EOS>
<SOS> the dropout rate of <NUM> subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout rate of <NUM> in the methadone group <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology <EOS>
<SOS> the result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid p 0 04 <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma surgery is a technically difficult procedure <EOS>
<SOS> whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease <EOS>
<SOS> most of these patients survive less than <NUM> months irrespective of the treatment modality <EOS>
<SOS> for diffuse pleural mesothelioma some favorable prognostic factors were identified imig international mesothelioma interest group stages i and ii epithelial type age under 50 female gender <EOS>
<SOS> in imig stages i and ii extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo and or radiotherapy is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> for this subset of patients a median survival time of between <NUM> and <NUM> months is reported <EOS>
<SOS> pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall irradiation is helpful sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> fetal magnetocardiography fmcg registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram fecg permits non invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the pqrst wave forms from the second trimenon onwards <EOS>
<SOS> this facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> we examined <NUM> women in <NUM> recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards 1 to <NUM> recordings per individual <EOS>
<SOS> the fmcg 37 magnetic channels sampling rate <NUM> hz bandwidth 1 200hz was recorded non invasively over the mother is abdomen in a magnetically shielded room <EOS>
<SOS> registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20 21th week of gestation onwards <EOS>
<SOS> in a few cases fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fmcg increased concordantly with fetal growth <EOS>
<SOS> mean p wave duration increased from <NUM> to <NUM> ms p 0 05 pq interval from <NUM> to <NUM> ms n s and qrs duration from <NUM> to <NUM> ms p 0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> the mean amplitudes of the p and r waves also increased <EOS>
<SOS> to demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in <NUM> patients 79 3 we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results <EOS>
<SOS> all in all we have found complications in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases we have seen a delayed wound healing in <NUM> cases a superficial infection in <NUM> cases a deep infection in <NUM> cases a neural damage and in <NUM> cases a phlebothrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> our study show that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals <EOS>
<SOS> the use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate <EOS>
<SOS> airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise <EOS>
<SOS> this very short noise has a peak amplitude of <NUM> db sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation <EOS>
<SOS> the 24 year old man has hearing loss both side in the 300 to 600 hz range and in the deep frequency <EOS>
<SOS> the possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura the pericardium and the peritoneum in germany has been rising since about the mid 1980 s a continuing rise is expected until about 2020 predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in germany between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the german mesothelioma registry in bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations <EOS>
<SOS> more than <NUM> mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the german mesothelioma registry <EOS>
<SOS> in this first part of the series on mesotheliomas current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> at the present specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known <EOS>
<SOS> the initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations <EOS>
<SOS> a reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic prognostic and medicolegal conseques in general it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages <EOS>
<SOS> acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10 <EOS>
<SOS> upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent 85 and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> the medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source <EOS>
<SOS> prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding reflected by clinical signs such as shock hemoglobin level transfused blood units hematemesis presence of comorbidity and age of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality <EOS>
<SOS> therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding <EOS>
<SOS> joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres nociceptors which are only activated by tissue damaging stimuli <EOS>
<SOS> this activation causes pain in conscious humans <EOS>
<SOS> the sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes <EOS>
<SOS> under these conditions normally innocuous and non painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain <EOS>
<SOS> the effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to their sensory function many nociceptors have an efferent function <EOS>
<SOS> they evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance p and calcitonin gene related peptide into the tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue <EOS>
<SOS> autolyzed antigen extracted allogeneic bone aa bone is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors <EOS>
<SOS> aa bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers bmps from its bone matrix <EOS>
<SOS> within a prospective study <NUM> cranial defects were reconstructed using aa bone implants over a period of more than <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were followed up at standardized intervals <EOS>
<SOS> roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the aa bone implants <EOS>
<SOS> in one quarter of the cases re entry was performed <NUM> to <NUM> months after the cranioplasty removal of osteosynthesis material recurrence of tumor <EOS>
<SOS> all nine aa bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations <EOS>
<SOS> a bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these aa bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant <EOS>
<SOS> in one case an aa bone implant was lost due to infection <EOS>
<SOS> this is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of aa bone for cranioplasties <EOS>
<SOS> large aa bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull is convexity especially when sterolithography based operation planning is performed <EOS>
<SOS> saphenous vein harvesting remains a <NUM> source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting <EOS>
<SOS> in an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure minimally invasive video assisted vein harvesting is propagated <EOS>
<SOS> the technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions <EOS>
<SOS> the dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips <EOS>
<SOS> the vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure <EOS>
<SOS> initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein preparation time of <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision <EOS>
<SOS> after a mean follow up of <NUM> months all bypasses are patent <EOS>
<SOS> taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration aspects of cost effectiveness are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently 70 in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6 <EOS>
<SOS> the reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period <EOS>
<SOS> a persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress <EOS>
<SOS> the recognition of a medical discipline on a european level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the european union <EOS>
<SOS> with supreme effort the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the eu reached this goal in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the uems section of stomatology and oromaxillofacial surgery became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the european commission <EOS>
<SOS> thanks to its activities oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about <NUM> specialists in <NUM> european countries <EOS>
<SOS> a biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68 year old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick sinus syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay <EOS>
<SOS> one electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual chamber pacemaker <EOS>
<SOS> the electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel <EOS>
<SOS> the pacemaker was programmed in dd mode with an av delay of <NUM> ms <EOS>
<SOS> under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with <NUM> mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient is history 24 h holter ecg nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow up of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the ab0 blood types first discovered by karl landsteiner in 1901 can be genotyped with the pcr method of lee and chang 6 <EOS>
<SOS> using two primer pairs allele specific sequences can be amplified and after digestion with restriction endonucleases visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel <EOS>
<SOS> in a southwest german population the allele frequencies were allele a <MOB> allele b <MOB> and allele <NUM> <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> with the method of lee and chang 6 only the nucleotide positions <NUM> and <NUM> are considered so that out of <NUM> individuals <NUM> 3 57 showed differences between the ab0 genotype and phenotype because it was not possible to differentiate between a and <NUM> alleles <EOS>
<SOS> based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given surgical equipment patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described <EOS>
<SOS> finally the results and possible complications are presented <EOS>
<SOS> removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work up the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population <EOS>
<SOS> cartilage treatment is technically possible however long term results are still missing <EOS>
<SOS> this is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses aa is technically demanding but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections <EOS>
<SOS> this should be addressed when performing the informed consent <EOS>
<SOS> recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic rectal and breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival <EOS>
<SOS> total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer <EOS>
<SOS> rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> in advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy <EOS>
<SOS> it has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival <EOS>
<SOS> up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy <EOS>
<SOS> following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher but survival is not significantly increased <EOS>
<SOS> introduction and methods a <NUM> t open configuration mr system allows free access to the patient via a 58 cm wide opening on both sides of the machine <EOS>
<SOS> a newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body <EOS>
<SOS> for imaging a 2d gradient echo sequence is used tr <NUM> ms te <NUM> ms flip angle <NUM> <NUM> ° fov <NUM> x <NUM> cm slice thickness <NUM> mm matrix <NUM> x 128 <EOS>
<SOS> the acquired images are displayed on two lcd screens localized within the mr system thus allowing an interactive needle guidance <EOS>
<SOS> this procedure is illustrated by a case report <EOS>
<SOS> angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> there is mounting evidence to suggest that ace inhibitors may be used for different indications as well <EOS>
<SOS> the rational for the use of ace inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin ii <EOS>
<SOS> the hemodynamic profile of ace inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide no <EOS>
<SOS> thus ace inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation <EOS>
<SOS> since vasoconstriction particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin angiotensin axis ace inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion <EOS>
<SOS> the critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods is still a major therapeutic challenge <EOS>
<SOS> intravenous preparations of ace inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients <EOS>
<SOS> however several questions about the exact mechanisms of ace inhibitors such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose are still open <EOS>
<SOS> moreover further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ace inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat micro circulatory catastrophe in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the pharmacologic properties of ace inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field <EOS>
<SOS> hypoparathyroidism hp results from deficient parathyroid hormone pth secretion pseudohypoparathyreoidism php results form decreased pth action on its target organs <EOS>
<SOS> between may <NUM> and 199 a total of <NUM> endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures <EOS>
<SOS> the operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused <EOS>
<SOS> in 62 of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne <EOS>
<SOS> the serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant each of which occurred in <NUM> case <EOS>
<SOS> comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence <EOS>
<SOS> various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned <EOS>
<SOS> it was the goal of this prospective study to compare <NUM> common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients <EOS>
<SOS> between september <NUM> and february <NUM> all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores initial parsonnet cleveland clinic french euro pons and the ontario province risk score <EOS>
<SOS> early lethality was assessed within <NUM> days postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> follow up was completed in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of the ontario province risk score lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores <EOS>
<SOS> mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome <EOS>
<SOS> with the aid of risk scores operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations <EOS>
<SOS> the euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients <EOS>
<SOS> however when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process <EOS>
<SOS> background and objective a complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> bullous haemorrhagic necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered <EOS>
<SOS> today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors particularly diabetes mellitus are often suggested <EOS>
<SOS> based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the department of dermatology in graz factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified <EOS>
<SOS> patients methods in a retrospective case control study clinical data sheets of <NUM> in patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> results general risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities pre existing hepatic or renal disease hyperuricaemia and diabetes mellitus <EOS>
<SOS> hepatic and renal disease and to a lesser extent diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne crotic lesions <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested <EOS>
<SOS> patients with end stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia <EOS>
<SOS> the onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> this substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that <NUM> <NUM> iu of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1 <EOS>
<SOS> we set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> fifty one adult patients were prospectively studied <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with antithrombin ii at ii activity 70 an at ii preparation kybernin behring marburg germany was given preoperatively mean dose <NUM> <NUM> iu following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80 <EOS>
<SOS> twenty seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure chf group with histologically proven cirrhosis and <NUM> had acute hepatic failure ahf group <EOS>
<SOS> blood samples were drawn prior to a 15 min infusion of at ii concentrate and <NUM> min thereafter <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with prothrombin time pt 40 at ii levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities 70 <EOS>
<SOS> prothrombin complex ppsb beriplex behring marburg germany was substituted mean dose <NUM> <NUM> iu to increase procoagulant activity to pt 60 <EOS>
<SOS> blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the at ii group <EOS>
<SOS> the amounts of at ii and ppsb concentrates at ii iu kg <NUM> ppsb iu kg required to increase at ii activity and pt respectively by 1 were calculated <EOS>
<SOS> standard calculations for at ii substitution indicated at ii recovery in all <NUM> patients who received at ii concentrate <EOS>
<SOS> however there was a statistically significant difference between patients with clf and alf <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with clf <NUM> at ii was found to be <NUM> iu kg <NUM> sem and in those with alf it was <NUM> iu kg <NUM> sem p0 05 <NUM> t test <EOS>
<SOS> in patients treated with ppsb concentrate <NUM> ppsb was <NUM> u kg <NUM> sem for both clf and alf groups <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with at ii concentrate are adequate only for patients with clf <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with alf higher at ii doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous at ii activity <EOS>
<SOS> procoagulant activity as reflected by pt can be increased by 1 when <NUM> iu kg ppsb concentrate is given <EOS>
<SOS> however this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only <NUM> min after administration <EOS>
<SOS> an increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of at ii activity in the alf group indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient is clinical symptoms and diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients <EOS>
<SOS> regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a <NUM> certain degree <EOS>
<SOS> a sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time <EOS>
<SOS> both occasions were associated with menstruation <EOS>
<SOS> mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once <EOS>
<SOS> discussion the etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described <EOS>
<SOS> the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <EOS>
<SOS> this case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process <EOS>
<SOS> porokeratos of mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization whose pathogenesis is not fully understood <EOS>
<SOS> the common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border <EOS>
<SOS> the histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella <EOS>
<SOS> an unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of mibelli is reported <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> with the introduction of the non benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines <EOS>
<SOS> we report two cases with high dose usage and dependency of non benzodiazepine hypnotics <EOS>
<SOS> both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode <EOS>
<SOS> while one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient <EOS>
<SOS> to reduce withdrawal symptoms long acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients <EOS>
<SOS> thus it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non benzodiazepine hypnotics <EOS>
<SOS> considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non benzodiazepine hypnotics <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro and supination <EOS>
<SOS> however traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective long term follow study 2 20 years after trauma of <NUM> children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in <NUM> of children only <EOS>
<SOS> these were not caused by radial head deformities which were present on <NUM> of follow up radiographs <EOS>
<SOS> functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> on follow up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to <NUM> <NUM> ° had corrected themselves spontaneously <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children <EOS>
<SOS> patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance <EOS>
<SOS> this is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift <EOS>
<SOS> further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic hyperoncotic solution group i hhl 10 hydroxyethylstarch 200 0 5 in 7 2 saline instead of two different standard colloid solutions group ii ha 5 albumin group ii hes 6 hydroxyethylstarch in 0 9 saline <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 il 1 induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide no <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase inos <EOS>
<SOS> methods articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in f12 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently cells 105 ml per well were transferred to flexercell plates grown to 90 confluency and subjected to one of the following regimens 1 no mechanical strain 10 hz 20 elongation rate 2 rhil 1 1 ng ml 3 mechanical strain 4 mechanical strain and rhil 1 <EOS>
<SOS> the cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for <NUM> h thereafter cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of inos was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti inos as primary antibodies and goat anti rabbit igg conjugated with horseradish peroxidase hrp as secondary antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for hrp <EOS>
<SOS> total no production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using greiss reaction <EOS>
<SOS> all experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by student is t test <EOS>
<SOS> results cells with treatment <NUM> and <NUM> did not exhibit presence of inos <EOS>
<SOS> il 1 treated cells in group <NUM> exhibited intense peroxidase staining <EOS>
<SOS> cells in group <NUM> exposed to il 1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity <EOS>
<SOS> control cells treated with normal rabbit igg as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining <EOS>
<SOS> the data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of no levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti inflammatory effects on chondrocytes downregulating the quantity of inos positive cells <EOS>
<SOS> since no acts as an intracellular transcellular and cytotoxic molecule it has a basic importance for proper post traumatic and postoperative tmj function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory tmj diseases <EOS>
<SOS> recently we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer <EOS>
<SOS> its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss <EOS>
<SOS> the transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ <EOS>
<SOS> efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears <EOS>
<SOS> after determining preoperative acoustical bera threshold the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph <EOS>
<SOS> bera responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo long incus process stapes head stapes foot plate and vestibulum <EOS>
<SOS> by comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> an electrical transducer voltage of <NUM> vrms was equivalent to sound pressure levels between <NUM> and <NUM> db spl at the tympanic membrane <EOS>
<SOS> to judge hearing impression stimulus dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials waves p1 to p5 and their thresholds were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> after coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process latencies corresponded well to stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> they were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound pressure level of <NUM> db spl was achieved by the transducer voltage level <EOS>
<SOS> pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in <NUM> by brunsting goeckermann and o leary <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology published by marie nicolas devergie in the first half of the 19th century which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin devergie is clinique de la maladie syphilitique includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury <EOS>
<SOS> devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy <EOS>
<SOS> thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than <NUM> years before first description in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled <EOS>
<SOS> the favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s <EOS>
<SOS> multiple system atrophy msa is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs <EOS>
<SOS> in msa patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies <EOS>
<SOS> however assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed <EOS>
<SOS> we report our clinical experience in managing a 56 year old obese male msa patient 1 76 m height <NUM> kg weight bmi <NUM> kg m2 who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy <EOS>
<SOS> polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals 11 1 h and an rdi of 1 4 h <EOS>
<SOS> sleep efficiency was low 51 9 due to long intermittent awake periods <EOS>
<SOS> sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during rem and non rem sleep <EOS>
<SOS> during inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring <EOS>
<SOS> this was regularly terminated by arousals <EOS>
<SOS> the further treatment is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in general glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in msa patients <EOS>
<SOS> however certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers <EOS>
<SOS> the source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy <EOS>
<SOS> introduction homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis <EOS>
<SOS> it is assumed that they possess anti infective properties <EOS>
<SOS> homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement <EOS>
<SOS> we present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century <EOS>
<SOS> the second part of this review decribes the following techniques laterofracture submucous turbinectomy concho antropexy partial turbinectomy anterior turbinectomy inferior turbinoplasty total turbinectomy and vidian neurectomy <EOS>
<SOS> indications advantages disadvantages complications and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed <EOS>
<SOS> partial or submucosal resection should be prefered because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology <EOS>
<SOS> total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed <EOS>
<SOS> acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl a vasodilator <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate <EOS>
<SOS> acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure in addition oxalate induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues <EOS>
<SOS> in terms of therapy hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful <EOS>
<SOS> generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to localized granuloma annulare generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients shows a stronger association with diabetes and is characteristically chronic <EOS>
<SOS> like our 55 year old patient most patients present with papules and annular plaques less often macular or non annular lesions may be encountered <EOS>
<SOS> histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma <EOS>
<SOS> instead there are diffuse dermal band like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery <EOS>
<SOS> because of its special characteristics it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis <EOS>
<SOS> using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis <EOS>
<SOS> neither ms 1 high molecular weight protein a new specific marker for cutaneous non langerhans cell histiocytoses nor cd1a the well known marker for langerhans cells and langerhans cell histiocytoses is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon 1 systemic treatment with interferon 2b 9x106 units three times a week was ineffective <EOS>
<SOS> the aims of the study were 1 to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade and 2 to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade i e the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train of four tof ratio 0 70 and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to tof ratio <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the spontaneous and neostigmine facilitated recovery in <NUM> healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone fentanyl droperidol and nitrous oxide was followed <EOS>
<SOS> post tetanic count ptc of tof stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission <EOS>
<SOS> the neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium <NUM> mg kg and supplemental doses of <NUM> mg kg were given when the first twitch response in the tof th1 had recovered to 20 <EOS>
<SOS> neostigmine <NUM> mg kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> multiple regression analyses including pre reversal time time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration ptc weight and age of the patients suggest that pre reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time reversal time 27 3 min<MOB>xpre reversal time min see 6 0 min <EOS>
<SOS> if pre reversal time is unknown ptc can be used reversal time 24 min 4 5xln ptc at time of reversal see 6 8 min <EOS>
<SOS> total recovery time was <NUM> min sem 2 0 min n 15 in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously and <NUM> min sem 1 2 min n 29 in the patients reversed by neostigmine the difference of <NUM> min se diff <NUM> min was significant p<MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the level of blockade indicated by ptc 1 24 at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time <EOS>
<SOS> the spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of th1 and th1 10 to tof ratio <NUM> were <NUM> min sem 1 7 min and <NUM> min sem 2 6 min respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the results suggest that pre reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade <EOS>
<SOS> to achieve the optimal time saving effect neostigmine must be given <NUM> min the time saved by giving neostigmine plus <NUM> to <NUM> min needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect giving a total of <NUM> to <NUM> min before tof ratio <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> as th1 is between 1 and 10 <NUM> to <NUM> min before tof ratio <NUM> is reached during spontaneous recovery the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when th1 is between 1 and 10 <EOS>
<SOS> reversal time can be predicted as <NUM> min<MOB>xpre reversal time min and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when th1 is 1 10 <EOS>

<SOS> since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology <EOS>
<SOS> new arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical partial tendon transfer and muscle transfer repairs <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of irreparable tears with cuff tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered <EOS>

<SOS> at the present time there is no effective treatment for psc although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid <EOS>
<SOS> however there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug because follow up time is not yet long enough <EOS>
<SOS> isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically <EOS>
<SOS> the possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of psc is controversial <EOS>
<SOS> liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for psc in its final stage <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 year survival rate 89 is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications <EOS>

<SOS> severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur <EOS>
<SOS> they happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra <EOS>

<SOS> the laboratory findings of hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation <EOS>
<SOS> a high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed <EOS>
<SOS> the high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade <EOS>
<SOS> however the fact that hellp syndrome can also occur for up to <NUM> week post partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question in particular since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute hellp syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> because of the correlation of complications of hellp syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features <EOS>
<SOS> the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in hellp syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept <EOS>
<SOS> innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects <EOS>
<SOS> in particular besides the external cuneate nucleus thick calibre neck muscle afferents project directly to the vestibular nuclear complex <EOS>
<SOS> this projection is most prominent in segments c2 and <NUM> and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments <EOS>
<SOS> thus proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input <EOS>
<SOS> proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from c2 and <NUM> compared to more caudal levels <EOS>
<SOS> likewise thin calibre mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents <EOS>
<SOS> it is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury <EOS>

<SOS> macular amyloidosis ma and lichen amyloidosus la are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching <EOS>
<SOS> various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids etretinate uvb irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success <EOS>
<SOS> recently in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide dmso <EOS>
<SOS> in our study <NUM> patients with either ma or la or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50 solution of dmso in water <EOS>
<SOS> 9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6 20 weeks of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by dmso is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within <NUM> weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis <EOS>
<SOS> in the follow up period relapses of itching and papules were observed <EOS>
<SOS> therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> as early as 1974 brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients 5 <EOS>
<SOS> he suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs thereby improving oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> these considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies 1 6 13 17 <EOS>
<SOS> better secretion removal decreased intrapulmonary shunting and an increased frc are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> however the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome ards <EOS>
<SOS> routine performance of thoracic ct scans in ards patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas <EOS>
<SOS> the prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients as shown by two recent studies 8 11 <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic ct findings in multiple trauma patients <EOS>

<SOS> redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic ct scans figs <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were intermittently turned for <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the course of gas exchange is shown in figs <EOS>
<SOS> initially improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning from the 2nd day in the supine position as well <EOS>
<SOS> intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend figs <EOS>
<SOS> no significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed <EOS>
<SOS> control thoracic ct scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas figs <EOS>
<SOS> the inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day fig <EOS>
<SOS> constant levels of positive end expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures fig <EOS>
<SOS> repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation which persists up to the end of the weaning process <EOS>
<SOS> this is in good accordance with other studies 1 2 6 8 11 13 17 however this is the first study to report an observation period of more than <NUM> days of repeatedly turning the patient <EOS>
<SOS> these positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position <EOS>
<SOS> due to reduced hydrostatic pressure 11 and relative hyperventilation 7 16 previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non dependent after turning to the prone position <EOS>
<SOS> after a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin a <NUM> year old patient developed right sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia septic toxic circulatory failure and thrombocytopenia <EOS>
<SOS> heparin associated thrombocytopenia hat type ii was diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava filter was implanted heparin therapy was stopped and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started <EOS>
<SOS> inspite of this an arterial thrombosis of the a femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically <EOS>
<SOS> from this time on no further thromboembolic complications were noticed <EOS>
<SOS> overlapping coumarin therapy was begun <EOS>
<SOS> due to ubiquitous coumarin necrosis rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation dic developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy <EOS>
<SOS> a second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin necrosis without the need for re operation <EOS>
<SOS> subsequent coumarin therapy which was gradually increased over two weeks was without further complications <EOS>

<SOS> brain nnos is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor which controls a ca2 channel <EOS>
<SOS> after its diffusion into the extraneuronal space no may activate in neurons which as a rule do not stain for nos soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cgmp as an intracellular messenger <EOS>
<SOS> beyond that no is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation <EOS>

<SOS> numerous studies conform to the view that no participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes especially of the corticotropin releasing hormone crh neurosecretory system <EOS>
<SOS> the redox modulatory site of the nmda receptor appears therefore as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical hpa axis <EOS>
<SOS> moreover glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake <EOS>
<SOS> in attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with no it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of no acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or in the worst case causing neurodestruction <EOS>
<SOS> it seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability with no working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition which may alter acutely or chronically among others the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system <EOS>

<SOS> according to watanabe three types can be differentiated the complete form the incomplete form and the hypermobile wrisberg form <EOS>
<SOS> discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment <EOS>
<SOS> partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible <EOS>

<SOS> in secondary prevention statins are cost effective and even more cost effective than other lipid lowering drugs <EOS>
<SOS> statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris <EOS>
<SOS> for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease statins should be administered generously <EOS>
<SOS> in primary prevention statins are effective but not cost efficient <EOS>
<SOS> unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women younger patients and in those with a low risk factor profile <EOS>
<SOS> for population based primary prevention only dietary measures can be advocated however apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven <EOS>
<SOS> preventive measures have their own prize in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it <EOS>
<SOS> therefore such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the direct medical costs <EOS>

<SOS> an essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ecg signal is the splitting of the ecg into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information <EOS>
<SOS> the correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure <EOS>
<SOS> this paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ecg <EOS>
<SOS> unlike the methods used up to now this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ecg signal into individual features <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other <EOS>
<SOS> the consideration underlying the procedure is that two ecgs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> as this assumption is the basis of medical experience it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ecg with those of the leads of the reference ecgs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ecg <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose those ecgs are searched in an ecg database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ecg <EOS>
<SOS> the function of the method was established with the aid of the ecg signal database cardiodat with <NUM> ecgs for the diagnostic groups infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of <NUM> ecgs <EOS>
<SOS> it can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ecg signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the technical conditions the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy ve are presented in an overview <EOS>
<SOS> during a 4 week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program <NUM> patients with coronary artery disease cad <NUM> men and <NUM> women 53 6 10 2 years performed 30 5 2 9 exercise units <EOS>
<SOS> before and after the rehabilitation program exercise capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry <EOS>
<SOS> there was a significant p0 001 increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program <MOB> 32 3 vs 121 9 37 3 w <EOS>
<SOS> physical work capacity on the <NUM> mmol lactate level improved p0 001 from 72 2 23 5 to 86 4 25 8 w on the <NUM> mmol l level p0 001 from 83 5 23 2 to 97 4 26 4 w and on the <NUM> mmol l level p0 001 from 93 1 23 0 to 106 6 26 1 w despite enhanced performance heart rate remained unaltered on the 2 0 2 5 and <NUM> mmol l lactate level <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly p0 001 increased 85 min from 56 0 24 1 to 65 8 24 5 w 90 min from 62 0 27 3 to 71 2 26 w 95 min from 67 2 26 4 to 77 5 27 6 w 100 min from 71 1 29 6 to 80 6 28 1 w 105 min from 69 8 26 2 to 81 9 28 2 w and 110 min from 73 6 28 9 to 90 4 29 4 w the results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with cad was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program <EOS>
<SOS> this improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity furthermore this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates <EOS>
<SOS> the results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program <EOS>
<SOS> thus this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and or the investigators during the re exercise test <EOS>
<SOS> on the contrary our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload <EOS>
<SOS> the effects were independent of pharmacological influences e g receptor antagonists <EOS>
<SOS> these findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with cad <EOS>
<SOS> newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries <EOS>
<SOS> missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up <EOS>

<SOS> the separation of whole blood into components is the state of the art in transfusion of allogeneic blood <EOS>
<SOS> the main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for ffp <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless especially in germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood <EOS>
<SOS> however most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood <EOS>
<SOS> additionally these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this <EOS>
<SOS> we analysed all articles listed by medline during the last <NUM> years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates <EOS>
<SOS> in addition all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> original articles abstracts reviews letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied <EOS>
<SOS> 28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the following in vitro parameters were also evaluated ph potassium load of the units atp and dpg concentration of the red cells <EOS>
<SOS> whole blood resuspended in cpda 1 and red cell units stabilized in cpda 1 or additive solutions with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable ph values and red cell 2 3 dpg and atp concentrations at the end of the approved storage time <EOS>
<SOS> the potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units <EOS>
<SOS> a number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage <EOS>
<SOS> a detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group <EOS>
<SOS> undoubtedly non hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions nhftr are generally caused by an antibody antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand there is some evidence that non specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing nhftr <EOS>
<SOS> thus these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion <EOS>
<SOS> however so far there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation <EOS>
<SOS> blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units <EOS>
<SOS> these fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre storage filtration of blood but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective <EOS>
<SOS> three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion in two of which red cell concentrates at least one was free of buffy coat had been used <EOS>
<SOS> thus there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood <EOS>
<SOS> after all whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters <EOS>
<SOS> hence a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the <NUM> h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations <EOS>
<SOS> physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status mobility and quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> however the central focus of this contribution is not on illness specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training <EOS>
<SOS> these two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process <EOS>
<SOS> the spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible <EOS>
<SOS> adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life <EOS>
<SOS> the arthroscopic extraarticular bankart procedure tries to imitate the open bankart procedure <EOS>
<SOS> an anterior inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim <EOS>

<SOS> contrast enhanced 3d mr angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest abdomen und lower extremities <EOS>
<SOS> the method combines intravenous bolus application of a non nephrotoxic paramagnetic extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3d data set <EOS>
<SOS> high contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues inherent three dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality <EOS>
<SOS> contrast enhanced 3d mra is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies <EOS>
<SOS> this review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples <EOS>
<SOS> the indications for magnetic resonance imaging mri on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical <EOS>
<SOS> a generalized contraindication for mri is doubtful <EOS>
<SOS> some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa spinal abscesses and internal derangements for the knee strongly recommend the advantages of mri versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> mri can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by 1 movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis 2 heating and 3 arrhythmias induced by electric currents and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation <EOS>
<SOS> present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a survey of twenty five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility safety or contraindication for mri on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in europe confirmed the safety of mri <EOS>
<SOS> however some gave their assurances based on inadequate data or assigned all responsibility to the physician <EOS>
<SOS> some companies did not give any assurance for mri safety or failed to respond to our enquiry <EOS>
<SOS> two valve manufacturers warned against performing mri on certain prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> based on our <NUM> questionnaire the technical issues the clinical circumstances the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for mri on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper <EOS>
<SOS> argyrophilic grain disease agd is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain <EOS>
<SOS> it is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein <EOS>
<SOS> histologically it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle shaped cellular inclusions argyrophilic grains <EOS>
<SOS> these cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from <NUM> individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable agd related changes of the brain <EOS>
<SOS> nearly one half of the cases 49 was classifiable as demented in accordance with dsm iv criteria <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the agd associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> these results confirm the assumption that agd can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia <EOS>
<SOS> they also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease <EOS>
<SOS> the major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy <EOS>
<SOS> by improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems which should help to avoid those complications the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased <EOS>
<SOS> the following case of an grade <NUM> open fracture of the femur with severe soft tissue damage including vascular lesions with consecutive massive transfusion should demonstrate that the cardiac respiratory system can still be stabilized even if a surgical solution seems impossible <EOS>
<SOS> annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight <EOS>
<SOS> our 17 year old female patient had a widespread reddish brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma <EOS>
<SOS> however the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> uv light was excluded as a trigger <EOS>
<SOS> other still unknown factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered <EOS>

<SOS> traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> it is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare <EOS>
<SOS> in the period between <NUM> january <NUM> and <NUM> december 1998 a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with balser plates <EOS>
<SOS> the population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations <EOS>
<SOS> a 81 year old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea <EOS>
<SOS> results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus <EOS>
<SOS> because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day <EOS>
<SOS> at autopsy we found a 2 cm diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected <EOS>
<SOS> the entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea to our knowledge has not yet been reported <EOS>
<SOS> the benefits of epidural analgesia are well known but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on <NUM> adult patients in three different operation groups <EOS>
<SOS> an epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5 7 days <EOS>
<SOS> there was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients perception of the treatment <EOS>
<SOS> mobilization differed as expected between the groups however even after the most major surgery e g cystectomy with bladder substitution mobilization was impressively unproblematic <EOS>
<SOS> retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given <EOS>
<SOS> the side effects such as sedation nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention <EOS>
<SOS> up to <NUM> showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic <EOS>
<SOS> complications one patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre existent carotid stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> in four patients the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration <EOS>
<SOS> there was no clinical evidence of hematoma abscess or permanent neurological damage <EOS>
<SOS> epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia mobilization and patient satisfaction bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications <EOS>
<SOS> it can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy <EOS>
<SOS> high resolution computed tomography hrct provides excellent contrast between osseous structures air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution <EOS>
<SOS> therefore thin section hrct with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures <EOS>
<SOS> the indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes cholesteatoma and tumor the postoperative middle ear and malformations <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases hrct enables differentiation between inflammatory changes cholesteatoma and tumor <EOS>
<SOS> the excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells of osseous defects of the tegmen of the bony labyrinth and of the tympanic course of the facial canal <EOS>
<SOS> in addition hrct enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles <EOS>
<SOS> although hrct is the first method of choice magnetic resonance imaging mri may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases <EOS>
<SOS> this is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by mri <EOS>
<SOS> in addition mri offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of iv contrast material <EOS>
<SOS> therefore mri may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes cholesteatoma and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by hrct <EOS>
<SOS> the differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by mri <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore mri can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes while this is not always possible by hrct <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in <NUM> patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study <EOS>
<SOS> in different stages of diverticulitis hinchey classification i <NUM> ii <NUM> ii <NUM> iv <NUM> mortality was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression <EOS>
<SOS> accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> in multivariate analysis surgical procedure primary resection <NUM> hartmann is procedure <NUM> non resection procedures <NUM> showed influence only on increased general complications <EOS>
<SOS> the role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> to december 1996 <NUM> cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of <NUM> patients were operated on conventionally and <NUM> patients underwent laparoscopic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique <EOS>
<SOS> the results indicated that in <NUM> patients 15 3 treated initially with the laparoscopic technique a switch to laparotomy was required <EOS>
<SOS> the operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy 75 min versus <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> however surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> the period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations <EOS>
<SOS> according to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> the sentinel lymph node dissection slnd is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> since the first report by morton et al <EOS>
<SOS> in 1992 the method has been refined and its use has increased <EOS>
<SOS> introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection elnd it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> slnd allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes false negative rate <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> it distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection <EOS>

<SOS> although children are injured everyday through accidents road traffic leisure or sports activities internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare <EOS>
<SOS> diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns <EOS>
<SOS> a retrospective controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in <NUM> children up to age <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the pattern of injury changed with increasing age the trauma remaining the same <EOS>
<SOS> most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament acl <EOS>
<SOS> main cause where sports activities <EOS>
<SOS> operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment <EOS>
<SOS> osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture <EOS>
<SOS> suturing of intraligamentous acl ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children <EOS>
<SOS> children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure <EOS>
<SOS> trauma surgery pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> malignant mixed müllerian tumours mmt are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case of a 46 year old female with mmt with primary occurrence in the greater omentum <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical appearance diagnosis therapy histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the publication of the consort statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> it contains the most important standards of high quality research <EOS>
<SOS> although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> the demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher <EOS>
<SOS> in the region of the ankle joint it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology <EOS>
<SOS> indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are soft tissue impingement ligament instability impingement in the syndesmosis osteochondral lesions loose bodies arthrosis and loose os trigonum of the talus <EOS>
<SOS> in the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments loose bodies and synovitis with soft tissue impingement <EOS>
<SOS> a new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint <EOS>
<SOS> the reported high incidence of complications especially in terms of neurovascular lesions can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non invasive distraction of the joint <EOS>
<SOS> although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease as proposed by the founders of the concept 125 <EOS>
<SOS> as the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored especially concerning 1 possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and 2 the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing <EOS>
<SOS> compared to the intense international discussion on the subject in germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia is role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease <EOS>
<SOS> our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain <EOS>
<SOS> in the etiopathology of tension type headache vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the ihs were investigated using the tcd ergometer test a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects <EOS>
<SOS> an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in <NUM> patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia cml to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon ifn and chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of cd61 megakaryocytes including their precursors with fiber density <EOS>
<SOS> this finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis <EOS>
<SOS> the latter was observed in about 28 of patients already at diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in a similar way the frequency of cd68 macrophages was correlated with the amount of ret40f nucleated erythroid precursors implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover hemoglobin synthesis and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts <EOS>
<SOS> the d galactosyl residue expressing pseudo gaucher cells were detectable in 30 of pretreatment specimens <EOS>
<SOS> moreover significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level percentages of myelo and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood and spleen size <EOS>
<SOS> these variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of cml <EOS>
<SOS> based on our morphometric evaluations a classification into three different histological subgroups granulocytic megakaryocytic and myelofibrotic was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> this simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data <EOS>
<SOS> sequential biopsies in <NUM> patients with monotherapy by ifn hydroxyurea hu or busulfan bu revealed a fibrogenic effect of ifn in contrast to a fiber reducing property of hu <EOS>
<SOS> the dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices <EOS>
<SOS> these included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time <EOS>
<SOS> thus in patients with complete hematological remission following ifn administration regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of cd68 macrophages including activated subpopulations <EOS>
<SOS> histological subgroups showed a transition from a nonfibrotic granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40 of patients <EOS>
<SOS> this change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in <NUM> patients 36 but predominantly in those under hu therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in cml warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and thus allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process <EOS>
<SOS> computer aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the icp reaches a plateau <EOS>
<SOS> our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models <EOS>
<SOS> for that we are able to take the non linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> the intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus <EOS>
<SOS> primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma <EOS>
<SOS> this also applies to unreamed medullary nailing <EOS>
<SOS> primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure the timing of which is not predictable <EOS>
<SOS> plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study conducted from <NUM> september <NUM> to <NUM> june <NUM> on <NUM> polytraumatized patients average iss <NUM> points simple femoral stem fractures a 1 to b 3 of the ao classification were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique <EOS>
<SOS> while cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression <EOS>
<SOS> at least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate <EOS>
<SOS> this allows micro movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue <EOS>
<SOS> all of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident <EOS>
<SOS> ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an x linked disorder of the urea cycle <EOS>

<SOS> coumarin necrosis is a rare but life threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy <EOS>
<SOS> predestined areas are the breasts hips gluteal region thighs or lower legs <EOS>
<SOS> thrombotic tendencies such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> a direct toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role <EOS>
<SOS> although the incidence is only <MOB> lethality lies at 15 the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually <EOS>
<SOS> the therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis <EOS>
<SOS> with special emphasis on pediatric aspects the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts are reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites <EOS>
<SOS> controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients <EOS>
<SOS> severe side effects seem to be rare but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction in infants and with rush immunotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> untill february <NUM> 6 376 patients were treated by our group with ptca and 3 859 60 5 received one or several stents <EOS>
<SOS> an angiographic follow up was achieved in 63 of the patients with 1 267 experiencing restenosis 32 8 <EOS>
<SOS> of those beeing treated with re ptca <NUM> were randomly selected for further analysis <EOS>
<SOS> in stent restenosis was treated with rotablator in <NUM> patients 2 7 with eximer laser in <NUM> 7 0 and with another stent in <NUM> patients 15 9 <EOS>
<SOS> 225 patients 74 4 of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only <EOS>
<SOS> it is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis pep whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here <EOS>
<SOS> regulations concerning prevention § <NUM> sgb v precautionary medical services § <NUM> sgb v and health examination § <NUM> sbg v offer no legal basis for cost coverage <EOS>
<SOS> pep is patient care in the sense of § <NUM> sgb v however this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations <EOS>
<SOS> this should be achieved soon in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area <EOS>
<SOS> the principles of the so called new methods of examination and treatment legal construct may support cost coverage liability <EOS>
<SOS> on the whole however german austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of pep must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously <EOS>
<SOS> if a doctor in the case of an indication according to the german austrian recommendations does not prescribe pep this would probably not be malpractice because there are still many scientific questions to be answered <EOS>
<SOS> to clarify the functional mechanism of the esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle the genioglossal muscle and the masseter muscle in <NUM> patients with sleep apnea syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> during the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea <EOS>
<SOS> no significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea but after the obstructive and central apnea significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand <EOS>
<SOS> the amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance <EOS>
<SOS> the results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx <EOS>
<SOS> the esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction but also affects function by activating the muscles <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis of the delinquency bringing disordered offenders into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity <EOS>
<SOS> this must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world wide medical and socio economic problem <EOS>
<SOS> in a recent report of the who the world wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority <EOS>
<SOS> inadequate long term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio economic burden to the health systems as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention <URL> directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity the early adiposity rebound intrauterine malnutrition weight gain during infancy low energy expenditure in infants familial adiposity composition of food and modification of fat intake <EOS>
<SOS> despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem <EOS>
<SOS> under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography mrt is the gold standard for early diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> because of magnetic interference this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation however <EOS>
<SOS> this seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under x ray control and the venous flow is documented <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas <EOS>
<SOS> ossovenography was performed in <NUM> patients and the results were compared with histological samples <EOS>
<SOS> in every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography 91 6 we also found necrosis on histological examination <EOS>
<SOS> in one patient in whom physiological flow was found there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample <EOS>
<SOS> there were no complications during ossovenography <EOS>
<SOS> the results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful <EOS>
<SOS> however the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy <EOS>
<SOS> for a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of <NUM> intra abdominal abscesses in <NUM> patients were demonstrated including the procedure and complications <EOS>
<SOS> for the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control <EOS>

<SOS> the primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> complications occurred in <NUM> of the cases with a mortality of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses especially in the critically ill patient <EOS>
<SOS> acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure icp <EOS>
<SOS> it is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors metabolic disturbances hypoxia and hypercapnia circulatory instability aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently <EOS>
<SOS> medical therapies for further treatment of elevated icp depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness <EOS>
<SOS> the different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and icp elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction <EOS>
<SOS> an algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed <EOS>
<SOS> in an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in <NUM> randomly selected german intensive care units as a part of the nidep study nosocomial infections in germany surveillance and prevention it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50 of the intensive care units <EOS>
<SOS> however craven et al <EOS>
<SOS> found that changing circuits including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier every <NUM> h rather than every <NUM> h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of these results and recent studies the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits <EOS>
<SOS> the key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins e g collagen proteoglycans and glycoproteins e g fibronectin as well as by well defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins <EOS>
<SOS> it has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 for example induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin 8 concentration <EOS>
<SOS> the proteases e g matrix metalloproteinase 8 released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized loss of decorin collagenous fiber network <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition <EOS>
<SOS> objectives the involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established <EOS>
<SOS> interleukin 1 il 1 is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis <EOS>
<SOS> because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins <EOS>
<SOS> the rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene lacz and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein il 1ra <EOS>
<SOS> different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> methods osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> the galactosidase lacz gene and the cdna of il 1ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer <EOS>
<SOS> lacz activity was determined by xgal staining il 1ra was measured quantitatively by elisa <EOS>
<SOS> results the transfer of retroviral il 1ra led to il 1ra expression of <NUM> to 10089pg irap 500 cells 48h <EOS>
<SOS> by combining different techniques to improve transduction the x gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60 <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> to provide a brief review of the current state of topical treatment with capsaicin or acetylsalicylic acid asa for therapy of chronic pain syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> we report a 72 year old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months <EOS>
<SOS> since the ct scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about <NUM> <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment <EOS>
<SOS> lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare <EOS>
<SOS> retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures <EOS>
<SOS> the survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma the time of diagnosis and a situation adapted therapeutic strategy <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients <EOS>
<SOS> early pelvic stabilization e g with external fixation is recommended in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma <EOS>
<SOS> early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair while deviation stomata or a hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses peritonitis or severe concomitant diseases <EOS>
<SOS> long lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation in these severe cases laparotomy should be aimed towards primary damage control and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries often involving the femoral vein <EOS>
<SOS> because of the famous case presented by roux in 1813 the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> zaufal is principle 1880 consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes <EOS>
<SOS> this surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever <EOS>
<SOS> in the limb the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially 1931 aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas <EOS>
<SOS> the first thrombectomy was performed in 1937 but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the german society of surgery in the following year <EOS>
<SOS> bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare <EOS>
<SOS> however their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses <EOS>
<SOS> further venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations <EOS>
<SOS> in the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super selective angiography and embolization <EOS>
<SOS> complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations <EOS>
<SOS> middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus <EOS>
<SOS> as the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein <EOS>
<SOS> a sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side <EOS>
<SOS> intoxication is the monotone reaction of the cns to consumed psychoactive substances <EOS>
<SOS> intoxication like conditions may also occur without taking drugs <EOS>
<SOS> we then use the term ecstasy <EOS>
<SOS> intoxication can follow typical or atypical course <EOS>
<SOS> the main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood affect drive and initiative train of thought and self control <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication <EOS>
<SOS> in a meta analysis of <NUM> prospective and retrospective studies we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations <EOS>
<SOS> androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair growth promoting agents <EOS>
<SOS> such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles especially of the shortened anagen phase and thus protect from increased hair loss <EOS>
<SOS> true evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic since trichograms the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity especially the duration of anagen stage <EOS>
<SOS> for example an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage but may also be due to shortened hair cycles <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics <EOS>
<SOS> for this approach dna flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth <EOS>

<SOS> a general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given <EOS>
<SOS> the remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100 for completely treated local relapses approximately 70 <EOS>
<SOS> the complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone <EOS>
<SOS> however thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur <EOS>

<SOS> the disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade <EOS>
<SOS> paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes pns are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment <EOS>
<SOS> most frequently pns occur in association with small cell lung breast or ovarian carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent pns is lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> pns have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> in certain neurologic syndromes sensible and autonomic neuropathy cerebellitis limbic encephalitis opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome stiff man syndrome neuromyotonia subacute amaurosis specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm <EOS>
<SOS> pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against 1 voltage gated calcium channels vgcc in lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome 2 voltage gated potassium channels vgkc in neuromyotonia and 3 recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy <EOS>
<SOS> the present article deals with the neurological symptoms of pns associated tumors and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of pns <EOS>
<SOS> ewing is sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has however attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time including a possible origin in immature reticulum myogenous endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells <EOS>
<SOS> repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis <EOS>
<SOS> convincing arguments however have only been brought forward during recent years since it was found that ewing is sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11 22 <EOS>
<SOS> in the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses <EOS>
<SOS> there seems to be no clear border between ewing is sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> histological differential diagnosis of ewing is sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases they can be distinguished from lymphoma leucocyte common antigen b and t markers and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma muscle specific actin desmin without problems <EOS>
<SOS> apart from that it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the mic 2 protein which is preferably expressed in ewing sarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostics of ewing is sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t 11 22 can be proved molecular biologically <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the cytogenetic evidence it is not necessary to establish cell cultures <EOS>
<SOS> contrast enhanced ce magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value <EOS>
<SOS> a prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three dimensional gradient echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a t1 shortening contrast agent <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the dependence of the quality of ce mra on technical parameters of different mr scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection <EOS>
<SOS> the present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration <EOS>
<SOS> owing to advances in adjuvant therapy the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades <EOS>
<SOS> this applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined <EOS>
<SOS> technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures such as tikhoff linberg resection at the shoulder internal hemipelvectomy proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented <EOS>
<SOS> the use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures <EOS>
<SOS> in the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in 10 30 of cases locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis a further <NUM> develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> in treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role <EOS>
<SOS> since another long lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation recurrence is not an infrequent event and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach <EOS>
<SOS> surgical techniques such as local myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection <EOS>
<SOS> additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem locoregional or systemic chemotherapy topical application of chemotherapy certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy pdt <EOS>
<SOS> the most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> in acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae <EOS>
<SOS> thus diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role <EOS>
<SOS> if acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> this is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated <EOS>
<SOS> if the diagnosis is unclear the next step should be either mri or 99m tc mdp bone scan depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion <EOS>
<SOS> mri is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> ga scan however should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure <EOS>
<SOS> the different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate clp patients <EOS>
<SOS> secondary corrections involve upper lip nose and palate fissures <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla <EOS>
<SOS> finally there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties <EOS>
<SOS> dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant borne prosthodontic work <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary clp care <EOS>
<SOS> damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome ards are the main lethal factors in burns patients <EOS>
<SOS> treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options <EOS>
<SOS> however no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42 and 48 respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ards <EOS>
<SOS> both patients were treated with bovine surfactant alveofact <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored <EOS>
<SOS> intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial o2 pressure pao2 inspired o2 concentration fio2 was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance <EOS>
<SOS> both patients survived this critical situation <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ards is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> the main aesthetic concern of patients with angle class ii deformities with skeletal deep bite short face syndrome is the short lower face <EOS>
<SOS> it is the orthodontist is task to correct this deformity insofar as possible <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the extent even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this <EOS>
<SOS> since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> it is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class ii deformities skeletal deep bite and a short lower face <EOS>
<SOS> presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of spee depending on the extent of the deformity to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function aesthetics and stability <EOS>
<SOS> it can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the real life test is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery <EOS>
<SOS> necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of transsexual defense and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity <EOS>
<SOS> usually therapeuts of transsexual patients who decide over somatic sex reassignement have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense <EOS>
<SOS> within the setting of the administrative psychotherapeutic split the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery <EOS>
<SOS> during recent years in the german federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms <EOS>
<SOS> the hospital sector as an element of this system has also been affected <EOS>
<SOS> based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization <EOS>
<SOS> from this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result <EOS>
<SOS> cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow up care <EOS>
<SOS> mostly the elderly are affected <EOS>
<SOS> medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between sgb v and sgb xi <EOS>
<SOS> however this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment rehabilitation before nursing priority of home etc <EOS>
<SOS> right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors <EOS>
<SOS> various medical nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the ethics commission of the medical university of lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure pid could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation <NUM> f508 <EOS>
<SOS> the couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening <EOS>
<SOS> ethically the performance of a pid was certainly warranted for this couple <EOS>

<SOS> introduction the prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation is especially in multi system trauma cases recognized to be the gold standard <EOS>
<SOS> thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation is becoming of increasing importance <EOS>
<SOS> thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings to identify areas for procedural optimization <EOS>
<SOS> staging of any tumor i e <EOS>
<SOS> determination of the extent of the disease serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies such as chemotherapy or irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis for radiation therapy planning and for differentiation of those with small cell lung cancer or for follow up examinations of small cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> the primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography ct of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands abdominal sonography and bone scintigraphy <EOS>

<SOS> health education should be directed towards patients behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> introduction in patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases but without known extrahepatic manifestations liver transplantation may be indicated as curativ or long term palliativ therapy <EOS>
<SOS> for these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> a patient suffering from long standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for <NUM> weeks with a mercury containing drug <EOS>
<SOS> exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed <EOS>
<SOS> mercury levels in blood and urine were increased <EOS>
<SOS> after withdrawal of the mercury preparation therapy with dmpa 2 3 dimercapto 1 propane sulfonic acid a mercury antidote was initiated together with short term treatment with aromatic retinoids and puva <EOS>
<SOS> within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20 <EOS>
<SOS> chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting <EOS>

<SOS> there is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities with 21 of patients with non obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality most often klinefelter is syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9 in patients with severe oligozoospermia less than <NUM> million ml and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group <EOS>
<SOS> using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells <EOS>
<SOS> there is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid disomic sperm cells than fertile men <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely <EOS>
<SOS> chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with icsi as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions <EOS>

<SOS> malnutrition is a common finding amongst our elders <EOS>
<SOS> the causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied they are not entirely understood <EOS>
<SOS> both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being undernourished <EOS>
<SOS> these may be related to social financial psychological and or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 76 year old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema <EOS>

<SOS> juvenile polyposis was first described by cronkhite and canada in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of cronkhite canada syndrome ccs however is still not well understood <EOS>
<SOS> interestingly among patients with ccs a significant correlation 16 5 with intestinal carcinomas has been observed <EOS>

<SOS> pacemaker erythema is a rare irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema <EOS>
<SOS> histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to peri or postoperative pacemaker infections physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results <EOS>
<SOS> the present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations <EOS>
<SOS> the physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription the period of time the drug is prescribed for numerous cross references and other special regulations and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements <EOS>
<SOS> often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in the authors opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system <EOS>
<SOS> it is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § <NUM> abs <EOS>
<SOS> 1 of the drug control regulation as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug and that any offence be punished <EOS>
<SOS> the use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof <EOS>

<SOS> managed care i e the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization is gaining importance in the usa health market <EOS>
<SOS> the initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums a very attractive feature for employers <EOS>
<SOS> managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care <EOS>
<SOS> given the shrinking public resources in germany managed care seems attractive for the german health system too <EOS>
<SOS> in this review the development of managed care the principal elements forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined <EOS>
<SOS> the regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians the physician must act as a double agent caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation <EOS>
<SOS> cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals and partly by restricting care for patients <EOS>
<SOS> only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations <EOS>
<SOS> the preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular <EOS>
<SOS> the paradigm of managed care i e to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost effective and high quality care seems very attractive <EOS>
<SOS> the stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the german health system in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in german law <EOS>

<SOS> background in the past the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect <EOS>
<SOS> since the target tissue is not directly observable no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> high inter and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under or overdosage <EOS>
<SOS> underdosage is therapeutically useless while overdosage causes the so called popeffects which may induce severe damage to the eye <EOS>
<SOS> in the past most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability hrv were done using commercial holter ecg devices with traditional magnetic tapes <EOS>
<SOS> all methods to calculate parameters of hrv are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats in practice rr intervals <EOS>
<SOS> hence results of hrv calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition <EOS>
<SOS> however technical standards on accuracy of rr interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state holter ecg systems do not exist as yet <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of hrv parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial holter ecg systems ela medical e oxford medilog excel o and medset cardiolight m <EOS>
<SOS> a computer based ecg simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial p qrs complexes of fixed rate quartz stabilized sinus rhythms <EOS>
<SOS> two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of recording technology on accuracy of rr interval measurement and consequently on time domaine hrv was shown by comparing five standard 24 h time domain parameters <EOS>
<SOS> as expected in the three holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher technically induced artificial rr variability <EOS>
<SOS> the sdnn values e 9 38ms vs 2 68ms p0 001 o 3 89ms vs 0 97ms p0 001 m 10 47ms vs 2 89ms p 0 001 sdnn index values e 8 22ms vs 0 90ms p0 001 o 3 75ms vs 0 90ms p0 001 m 7 81ms vs 1 49ms p0 001 and rmssd values e 10 39ms vs 2 16ms p0 001 o 10 05ms vs 1 88ms p0 001 m 8 62ms vs 1 69ms p0 001 were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems sdann m 9 83ms vs 5 37ms p0 001 in the medset system too <EOS>
<SOS> the used method is a possible way to validate commercial holter ecg systems for hrv analysis <EOS>

<SOS> in the triad of known gallstone non specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus <EOS>
<SOS> the evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in <NUM> and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> there has been no significant change in mortality for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques <EOS>
<SOS> recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions <EOS>
<SOS> however attempts to restore forearm hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management <EOS>
<SOS> leg venectasia is a common problem <EOS>
<SOS> although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities none of them gives satisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> the effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor <EOS>
<SOS> electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring <EOS>
<SOS> we studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of <NUM> nm in the treatment of leg venectasia <EOS>
<SOS> after repeated treatments using this laser system only 30 of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed we obtained better lightening of smaller red telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> however hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in post treatment biopsies occlusion of the vessels was found <EOS>
<SOS> based on these results we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia <EOS>
<SOS> larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser <EOS>
<SOS> total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients <EOS>
<SOS> a less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ <EOS>
<SOS> hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an al2o3 ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients <EOS>

<SOS> it is further possible to display static 3d as well as <NUM> dynamic organs 4d e g <EOS>
<SOS> the clarity of the three dimensional presentation supports very effectively the navigation <EOS>
<SOS> 58 patients following gustilo iib open tibial fractures treated by serial debridements osteosynthesis and microvascular free tissue transfer were investigated after an average of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument flz fragen zur lebenszufriedenheit <EOS>
<SOS> further specific questions on treatment satisfaction aesthetic result occupation and income were added to this questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities income occupation and partnership productivity mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population <EOS>
<SOS> the calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population <EOS>
<SOS> although specific aspects like aesthetic result donor site morbidity pain and even function were critically judged <NUM> of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment <EOS>
<SOS> none of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution <EOS>
<SOS> the postrehabilitation employment rate was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> limb salvage of gustilo iib fractures by means of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol is able to afford useful and satisfying long time results <EOS>
<SOS> however an impairment of quality of life at least in specific items has to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a 10 year old boy with post traumatic priapism after perineal trauma is presented <EOS>
<SOS> interdisciplinary treatment using angiography and selective catheter embolization for juvenile high flow priapism is demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> the literature and the diagnostic possibilities resulting from color duplex sonography are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> only 53 58 of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage sab following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral vasospasm <EOS>
<SOS> the following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists hypervolaemic haemodilution and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature <EOS>
<SOS> during the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical hallmark is a sterile pustular dermatosis preferentially located in intertriginous regions that responds to local or systemic corticosteroids <EOS>
<SOS> histologic features are subcorneal sometimes spongiform neutrophilic pustules <EOS>
<SOS> we report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis <EOS>
<SOS> an overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses <EOS>
<SOS> the area environment and health is characterized by interdisciplinary features and consequently an intense need for communication <EOS>
<SOS> in addition it has to be considered that sometimes there are difficulties in terms of information search <EOS>
<SOS> a comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a european information and communication platform <EOS>
<SOS> by this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences coordination of activities harmonization efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier <EOS>

<SOS> no removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods <EOS>
<SOS> five eyes donated for corneal allografting without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types i ii iv and vi and against laminin proliferating antigen ki <NUM> and gfap <EOS>
<SOS> in glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking <EOS>
<SOS> septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged <EOS>
<SOS> the immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes <EOS>
<SOS> the axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern <EOS>
<SOS> the number of proliferating cells with positive gfap staining in glaucomatous cribriform plates is distinctly higher <EOS>
<SOS> we postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation <EOS>
<SOS> associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and secondarily to neural degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> concomitant pathologies labral lesions intra extra osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema in adult residual hip dysplasia rhd might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative mr arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in rhd <EOS>
<SOS> the first <NUM> consecutive patients with a minimum follow up of <NUM> months have been analysed <EOS>
<SOS> all <NUM> patients presented rhd with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative mra <EOS>
<SOS> according to clinical radiological and mr arthrographical criteria these <NUM> patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups 1 reorientation of the acetabulum using the tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy tpo 2 intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy ivo 3 palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum pall 4 primary total hip replacement tep <EOS>
<SOS> based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups the following conclusions can be drawn labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability <EOS>
<SOS> therefore acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum tpo subgroup even in low grades of rhd if labral lesions are present <EOS>
<SOS> palliative labral resections without corrective osteotomy pall subgroup in secondary osteoarthritis due to rhd are definitively obsolete because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability <EOS>
<SOS> in rhd with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions one should not hesitate to perform primary thr even in young patients <EOS>
<SOS> severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus <EOS>
<SOS> in this connection open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned <EOS>
<SOS> in the department of traumatology braunschweig in <NUM> three patients all male average age <NUM> <NUM> years were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus <EOS>
<SOS> in two of these cases third degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained <EOS>
<SOS> the third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital <EOS>
<SOS> in each case a fulminating infection was the outcome <EOS>
<SOS> following a step by step algorithm in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done <EOS>
<SOS> to maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other the bony defect was filled with pmma chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection <EOS>
<SOS> after second and third look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> <NUM> days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft combined with double arthrodesis in two cases and external fixation for the next 4 5 weeks <EOS>
<SOS> in the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up after an average of <NUM> months range 8 17 months the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> all patients are free of symptoms in normal life <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum <EOS>
<SOS> meningitis caused by streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a <NUM> year old female in austria <EOS>
<SOS> sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment <EOS>
<SOS> being a farmer the patient belongs to a recognized high risk group as most other infected people do <EOS>
<SOS> to the best of our knowledge there has been no report of a human infection by streptococcus suis in austria so far <EOS>
<SOS> the results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis and thus are in contrast to the guinea pig model by kay who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss <EOS>
<SOS> the present knowledge of streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology pathogenesis epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients <EOS>
<SOS> it is assumed that in the near future neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients <EOS>
<SOS> the present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings <EOS>
<SOS> numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> to study this the data of <NUM> patients with multiple traumata treated between <NUM> and <NUM> at hannover medical school germany were retrospectively analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were divided into four age related groups preschool age <NUM> years school age <NUM> years teenagers <NUM> years and adults l <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> analyzed were the cause of trauma localization of injuries and the cause of death <EOS>
<SOS> children were less often injured as passengers in cars but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults <EOS>
<SOS> however children showed a significant higher mortality than adults with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents <EOS>
<SOS> in all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common <EOS>
<SOS> children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax abdomen hip and arms than the adult group <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless trauma to the thorax abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups <EOS>
<SOS> spinal cord injuries especially injuries to the neck also showed a high risk of death <EOS>
<SOS> children younger than <NUM> years had the most severe head injuries <EOS>
<SOS> safety improvements for children in cars helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> during the past <NUM> years <NUM> patients have been operated upon using the childs phillips method <EOS>
<SOS> of those <NUM> were subsequently examined for the study <NUM> patients had died in the meantime <EOS>
<SOS> none of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small bowel plication <EOS>
<SOS> an early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in <NUM> and a laparotomy was repeated <EOS>
<SOS> during the most recent examinations <NUM> of those patients checked had virtually no complaints <NUM> based upon the visick classification <EOS>
<SOS> a subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in <NUM> of cases but could be conservatively treated <EOS>
<SOS> up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of our results we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis as well as partial plication is acceptable <EOS>
<SOS> to prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns as no such study has as yet been performed in germany <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 35 year old patient suffering from schizoaffective psychosis <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> weeks on clozapine he developed acute priapism <EOS>
<SOS> possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> delay of urgent urologic treatment incrases the risk of irreversible impotence <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections <EOS>
<SOS> the further development of <NUM> stroke patients average age <NUM> years who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization was evaluated ca <EOS>
<SOS> questionnaires were mailed to patients <EOS>
<SOS> 53 of the patients n 86 returned the questionnaire duly filled in 20 n 32 had died in the remaining 27 of cases n 44 no information was obtained on further development <EOS>
<SOS> 80 of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems <EOS>
<SOS> family members assumed most of the care required <EOS>
<SOS> follow up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic <EOS>
<SOS> the barthel index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital <EOS>
<SOS> hardly anyone among those patients received follow up treatment <EOS>
<SOS> 74 of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor <EOS>
<SOS> for those patients who died in the <NUM> months interval significantly lower values for the activities of daily living adl has already been recorded upon hospitalization <EOS>
<SOS> they had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general <EOS>
<SOS> the routine staging work up for renal cancer includes a contrast enhanced multiphasic spiral ct and a chest radiograph <EOS>
<SOS> if there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of supradiaphragmatic ivc thrombus mr imaging should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> dynamic contrast enhanced mr imaging should be used in place of ct in any patient with severe renal dysfunction symptomatic polycystic kidney disease or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media <EOS>
<SOS> cavography is no longer needed in the era of adaptive array detector spiral ct and mr venography <EOS>
<SOS> patients we report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form <EOS>
<SOS> despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of <NUM> and <NUM> months respectively only one survived severely retarded with seizures opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia <EOS>
<SOS> the serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome <EOS>
<SOS> the patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development <EOS>
<SOS> immunosuppression related candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators notably tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf interleukin <NUM> il 1 and gamma interferon gamma ifn <EOS>
<SOS> important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram negative bacteremia and endotoxemia <EOS>
<SOS> optimistically preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise and actually may improve the efficacy of synthetic antifungals <EOS>
<SOS> such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents <EOS>
<SOS> bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> using a bilateral approach preoperative localization studies are not mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> a localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure <EOS>
<SOS> therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning minimally invasive first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of <NUM> mtc sestamibi scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in <NUM> of all single gland diseases <EOS>
<SOS> multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only <EOS>
<SOS> computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results <EOS>
<SOS> surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies <EOS>
<SOS> prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of 90 min compared to in hospital therapy is expected <EOS>
<SOS> it has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy <EOS>
<SOS> more than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the ems may be treated within <NUM> min after symptom onset enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk <EOS>
<SOS> thus prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window without additional risk <EOS>
<SOS> moreover technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled <EOS>
<SOS> low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter saving method <EOS>

<SOS> eighteen patients received a transanal sutured anastomosis <NUM> a stapler anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> we had a lethality rate of <NUM> and a anastomotic insufficiency rate of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> notox histological fixative is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested <EOS>
<SOS> notox was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step otherwise the same manufacturer specified protocols were used for all reagents <EOS>
<SOS> conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations especially for tumour diagnosis were used <EOS>
<SOS> in all tests results with notox fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> notox is a useful substitute for formaldehyde <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this article is to provide current information on morphological parameters useful for a forensic age estimation of human skin wounds <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed <EOS>
<SOS> a dynamic helical ct scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries <EOS>
<SOS> it also proves useful for pediatric traumas <EOS>
<SOS> using mainly ct data we apply a classification system proposed by the american association for surgery of trauma grade i v <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic steps and subsequent management are demonstrated by flow chart <EOS>
<SOS> most renal traumas may be treated conservatively but persistent bleeding or persistent urinary extravasation may necessitate surgical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of exploration of the kidney the use of fibrin adhesive alloplastic mesh capsule and dj stents enables the reconstruction of the kidney <EOS>
<SOS> exploration of the renal injury should never be omitted if urgent laparotomy is indicated for associated injuries <EOS>
<SOS> with worldwide over 1million applications vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology <EOS>
<SOS> this overview compares today is four commercially available closure devices vasoseal vs angio sealtm as perclose inc pc and duettm du for their usefulness after coronary interventions <EOS>
<SOS> the published data regarding deployment success rates for vs as pc and du are in the range of 88 91 90 and 98 up to 100 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> times to hemostasis were 5 13 2 4 11 19 and 4 14 accompanied by times to mobilization of 6 9h 6 8h 4 7h and 2 6h <EOS>
<SOS> minor complications were described in 8 5 9 5 3 and 2 1 major complications in 5 3 1 3 4 and 2 6 <EOS>
<SOS> although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis <EOS>
<SOS> the increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after ptca <EOS>
<SOS> vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge <EOS>
<SOS> amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> polyhydramnios occurs in <NUM> to <NUM> of pregnancies <EOS>
<SOS> it may be due to a number of congenital anomalies an abnormal karyotype maternal diabetes rh disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non invasive or invasive measures <EOS>
<SOS> however the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the twin twin transfusion syndrom tts <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid <EOS>
<SOS> maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further non invasive therapeutic option <EOS>
<SOS> indomethacin sulindac or nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures <EOS>
<SOS> however potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application <EOS>
<SOS> percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure but is associated with a complication rate of <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by tts have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment <EOS>
<SOS> treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios <EOS>
<SOS> mild cases can be managed expectatively <EOS>
<SOS> intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume afi <NUM> mm or mvp <NUM> mm leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure <EOS>
<SOS> complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery <EOS>
<SOS> the main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and or the alleviation of maternal symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> with the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging frame based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation also called frameless stereotaxy <EOS>
<SOS> it allows transfer of individual patient is images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas <EOS>
<SOS> the different localization techniques employed are articulated position sensing arms infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> operations performed with different systems arm based robotic and infrared the method proved to be helpful enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed <EOS>
<SOS> with a mean deviation of <NUM> <NUM> mm for intraoperative localization the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame based stereotaxy with deviations below <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions skull base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality <EOS>
<SOS> the major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging mri might be a solution for this problem <EOS>
<SOS> with the method of intraoperative mri developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy <EOS>
<SOS> therefore neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine and it will also spread into other surgical specialties <EOS>
<SOS> severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation bmt patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment <EOS>
<SOS> cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to bmt and may result from cerebral opioid side effects <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side effects in bmt patients <EOS>
<SOS> particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance are influenced by pain induced cognitive impairments in pain patients <EOS>
<SOS> methods while in hospital <NUM> bmt patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale subjective visual analog scales vas for pain and mood parameters a german version of the mcgill pain questionnaire mpq and a mental performance task battery and the morphine given was documented <EOS>
<SOS> mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time <EOS>
<SOS> seven patients also performed a sternberg memory search test in which they had to use yes and no response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters <EOS>
<SOS> practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before bmt <EOS>
<SOS> results the intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient resulting in different pain intensities and mpq scores <EOS>
<SOS> prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity spearman rs 0 88 p 0 01 but not with morphine dose rs 0 35 p 0 33 <EOS>
<SOS> for the sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose rs 0 86 p 0 014 than between reaction time and residual pain intensity rs 0 61 p 0 15 <EOS>
<SOS> in turn pain intensity unlike morphine dose was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression passivity and tiredness <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions it is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria <EOS>
<SOS> whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient is attention particularly in low mental demand tasks morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes such as short term memory operations that are required in more complex tasks <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a 63 year old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described <EOS>
<SOS> histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died in acute cardiac failure five weeks after initial presentation <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium <EOS>
<SOS> macroscopically the bone marrow appeared normal <EOS>
<SOS> the tumor cells were reactive for cd45 vimentin and chloroacetate esterase but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c kit cd117 characteristic markers for mast cells <EOS>
<SOS> however the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis <EOS>
<SOS> a diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule <EOS>
<SOS> thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process <EOS>
<SOS> we report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential borderline tumors of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on <EOS>
<SOS> in one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems <EOS>
<SOS> the second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> in stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective <EOS>
<SOS> thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases <EOS>
<SOS> brain stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the mesencephalon pons and medulla oblongata <EOS>

<SOS> the criteria are the primary site size tumor growth brain stem enlargement delineation intralesional structure exophytic components and enhancement <EOS>
<SOS> secondary criteria are herniation hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding <EOS>
<SOS> in ct glioma are hypodense in mri hyperintense in t2 and hypointense in t1 <EOS>
<SOS> enhancement is seen in 25 60 and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings <EOS>
<SOS> factors influencing poor outcome are high grade a short history cranial nerve involvement severe brain stem enlargement pontine site diffuse growth and recurrency <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 year survival rate is 30 after radiation focal tumors 85 diffuse 20 <EOS>
<SOS> most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure cerebellum cranial nerves and pyramidal tract <EOS>
<SOS> there is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not <EOS>
<SOS> a diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical mri findings fit the clinical history <EOS>
<SOS> radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation <EOS>

<SOS> no severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed <EOS>
<SOS> clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> to continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in heidelberg <EOS>
<SOS> indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule and more rarely in fractures <EOS>
<SOS> anterior shoulder dislocation is common <EOS>
<SOS> over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice <EOS>
<SOS> isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally <EOS>
<SOS> a torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises <EOS>
<SOS> chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by aci grafting techniques <EOS>
<SOS> menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically <EOS>
<SOS> objective comparison of low back pain lbp patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome fms with regard to affective distress <EOS>
<SOS> methods patients with lbp who had been admitted to various clinics in germany were examined upon admission <EOS>
<SOS> comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of fms <EOS>
<SOS> additionally both groups were compared after being matched according to sex age and pain severity <EOS>
<SOS> results <NUM> out of <NUM> lbp patients met the american college of rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia <EOS>
<SOS> patients with fms showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress <EOS>
<SOS> after controlling for different levels of pain severity these pronounced differences disappeared <EOS>

<SOS> methods cases of invasive hi infections were reported in a national active surveillance program <EOS>
<SOS> the case definition required the typical clinical picture and a hi positive culture from a physiologically sterile site or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia in children up to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> all initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status type of vaccine therapy outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria <EOS>
<SOS> the relation between the type of hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame <EOS>
<SOS> results <NUM> confirmed cases of invasive hi infections were reported during the observation period <NUM> of these with meningitis <NUM> with epiglottitis <EOS>
<SOS> the number of cases declined from <NUM> in the last six months of 1992 <NUM> in 1993 and <NUM> in <NUM> to <NUM> cases in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the incidence in up to <NUM> year old children was 1 1 100 <NUM> for all infection sites and 0 7 100 <NUM> for meningitis <EOS>
<SOS> the reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between <NUM> and <NUM> per year <EOS>
<SOS> most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children who according to the german recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection <EOS>
<SOS> the type of vaccine hboc prp d or omp was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children <EOS>
<SOS> 10 of the bacteria produced betalactamase <EOS>
<SOS> in accordance with the german recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis <EOS>
<SOS> one third of these however received additional antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the present incidence of systemic hi infections in germany is low <EOS>
<SOS> a further decrease however would be possible with on time completion of the vaccination schedule according to the german recommendations in all children <EOS>
<SOS> for more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion ischemia dissication and foreign bodies result in complaints intestinal obstruction female infertility and problems during reoperations <EOS>
<SOS> the global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion related complications and subsequent socio economic implications <EOS>
<SOS> as of today there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available <EOS>
<SOS> scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> even today the name of f d von recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> he was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones and in many aspects his work remains valid today <EOS>
<SOS> he succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases <EOS>
<SOS> he also described the phenomenon of bone remodeling which has become relevant today again <EOS>
<SOS> although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas <EOS>
<SOS> this article does not constitute a comprehensive biography but it contains a description of f d von recklinghausen is important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life <EOS>
<SOS> soft tissue sarcomas sts of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation <EOS>
<SOS> in order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion ilp in a multimodality therapy concept we reviewed our patients treated using this method <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and december 1995 <NUM> ilps using cisplatin melphalan and adriamycin were performed in <NUM> patients with sts <EOS>
<SOS> forty percent were treated for local recurrences histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh and synovial sarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> in all <NUM> of the sts were classified as uicc stage iib or iia b <EOS>
<SOS> most of the cases 14 underwent wide or radical resection <NUM> patients received intraoperative radiotherapy and <NUM> were treated with external beam radiation <EOS>
<SOS> complications were recorded in <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> with a median follow up of <NUM> months range 1 143 the 5 year overall survival rate was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the median recurrence free time was <NUM> months and the 5 year disease free survival rate <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> local failures and distant metastases developed in <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> concerning high grade sarcomas uicc stage iib iia b we found local recurrences in <NUM> of all cases <EOS>
<SOS> five of <NUM> patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation and <NUM> incompletely resected sts received ilp without reoperation <EOS>
<SOS> all of these demonstrated local recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> this rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor free resection margins p <MOB> log rank test <EOS>
<SOS> the amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was <NUM> mean <NUM> months after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> long term results of ilp showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease free survival <EOS>
<SOS> perfusion in patients without tumor free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that ilp with cisplatin melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice <EOS>
<SOS> infections with the grampositive bacterium clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics <EOS>

<SOS> huntington is disease hd may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features especially at the beginning of the illness <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 21 year old woman with definite hd whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> one reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of hd compared with that of other affected relatives <EOS>
<SOS> the phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history <EOS>

<SOS> thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator rt pa has proved to be an established method but intra and postoperatively there is a high risk of bleeding complications <EOS>
<SOS> a 50 year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperatively petco2 suddenly dropped paco2 rose and circulatory arrest occurred <EOS>
<SOS> cpr was started immediately with closed chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines <EOS>
<SOS> while continuing cpr surgery was stopped the wound was sealed provisionally and the patient was transferred to the icu <EOS>
<SOS> because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism thrombolytic therapy with rt pa in a total dosage of <NUM> mg was begun <EOS>
<SOS> 2 25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest and <NUM> hours after the beginning of thrombolysis the patient is hemodynamic patterns under high dosage catecholamines were satisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> the bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions <EOS>
<SOS> the situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver spleen and small intestines which required surgical intervention and acute renal failure which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration <EOS>
<SOS> twenty eight days after receiving cpr the patient was discharged from the icu <EOS>
<SOS> a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs capnometry blood gas analysis and electrocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> due to the requirements of the emergency situation ongoing cpr further diagnostic tools were not used <EOS>
<SOS> the patient survived without any neurological deficiency despite the extended 135 min use of cpr and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma and to performing cpr in the presence of fibrinolytica <EOS>
<SOS> with the increasing use of cross sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms more and more right atrial thrombi are detected <EOS>
<SOS> these are so called transitthrombi from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease <EOS>
<SOS> they appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism <EOS>
<SOS> in patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in our hospital we have seen <NUM> patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism seven patients presented with a submassive embolism <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography <EOS>
<SOS> in about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic options were thrombectomy fibrinolysis or anticoagulants <EOS>
<SOS> we treated one of our patients with thrombectomy eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants <EOS>
<SOS> the era of modern anaesthesia in germany began on january 24th <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this day professor in ordinary johann ferdinand heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the university of erlangen <EOS>
<SOS> by march 17th 1847 heyfelder had performed <NUM> surgical procedures under ether <EOS>
<SOS> the operations in majority were teeth extractions and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint <EOS>
<SOS> heyfelder described in detail <NUM> of these inhalations in a little book entitled the experiments with sulphuric ether <EOS>
<SOS> this monograph published in march 1847 represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the german literature <EOS>
<SOS> in a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization <EOS>
<SOS> heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations <EOS>
<SOS> in 1847 heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt ether in man <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether <EOS>
<SOS> advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction <EOS>
<SOS> disadvantageous were its high volatility its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form <EOS>
<SOS> from december 1847 on heyfelder started to use chloroform <EOS>
<SOS> he was now able to perform more major operations for example the total resection of the hip joint <EOS>
<SOS> in his book the experiments with sulphuric ether salt ether and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these <NUM> agents <EOS>
<SOS> in his summary heyfelder concluded that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis <EOS>
<SOS> moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus <EOS>
<SOS> however because of its great anaesthetic potency heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform <EOS>
<SOS> explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist <EOS>

<SOS> the uniform development of the human embryo as described by classic human embryology has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies <EOS>
<SOS> in particular the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination because the large cystic cavities of the brain can easily be imaged <EOS>
<SOS> sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs but also the development of structural abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> approximately one third of all congenital anomalies originate from the central nervous system cns <EOS>
<SOS> based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early cns anomalies we recognize some sonographic signs of an early cns anomaly 1 apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head 2 altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal 3 in the early fetal period choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall 4 irregular contour of the spine back 5 extra cns anomalies <EOS>
<SOS> in the following survey normal sonoembryology of the cns is described and cns anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening <EOS>
<SOS> it has been implicated in cellular senescence immortalization and carcinogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> over 85 of human tumours and 95 of non melanocytic skin cancers show telomerase activity in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues <EOS>
<SOS> this suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues but also in some normal tissues <EOS>
<SOS> in the skin this activity has been traced to the stem cell bearing epidermal basal cell layer possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase competent stem cells <EOS>
<SOS> these findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues <EOS>
<SOS> as a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated some caution is warranted <EOS>
<SOS> the established criteria of auditory brainstem responses abr such as jv latency ji v interpeak latency and interaural differences of <NUM> latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present <EOS>
<SOS> however the abr can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization even though pure one audiometry indicates that responses should be present <EOS>
<SOS> this retrospective study compared the abr and pure tone thresholds in <NUM> cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of <NUM> cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies <EOS>
<SOS> the average deficit of the objective abr threshold doabrt to the subjective pure tone threshold for those frequencies between 1 6 khz was <NUM> db for the control group abr and pure tone thresholds very close and <NUM> db for the tumor group abr threshold much higher than the pure tone threshold <EOS>
<SOS> abr thresholds <NUM> db higher than the high frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40 6 of the tumor group and in none of the control group <EOS>
<SOS> thus deficits of the abr threshold 30 db can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases abr sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent <EOS>
<SOS> the association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot nevus fuscoceruleus nevus spilus and with variable frequency with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis a genodermatosis first described by ota and co workers <EOS>
<SOS> four different combinations have been specified <EOS>
<SOS> most cases are reported from the japanese literature <EOS>
<SOS> phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder but overlapping with other syndromes like klippel trenaunay syndrome or sturge weber syndrome is also possible <EOS>
<SOS> we report a 30 year old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back <EOS>
<SOS> orif management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type a3 of the a0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments particularly when only the sliding hip screw is used for fixation <EOS>
<SOS> a connectable butt press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> we review the results with this fixation technique in <NUM> elderly patients with an average age of <NUM> years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the a3 type <EOS>
<SOS> three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed <EOS>
<SOS> the other <NUM> were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred <EOS>
<SOS> complaints leg shortening and changes in the ccd angle were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the mobility score was determined <EOS>
<SOS> although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> patient had a varus dislocation of <NUM> <NUM> ° until the fracture had consolidated <EOS>
<SOS> this was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head <EOS>
<SOS> no pseudarthrosis osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted <EOS>
<SOS> five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of this review we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type a3 <EOS>
<SOS> superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system <EOS>
<SOS> chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue <EOS>
<SOS> there is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly among a variety of symptoms cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur <EOS>
<SOS> to date the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural <EOS>
<SOS> we present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant <EOS>
<SOS> audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve <EOS>
<SOS> these findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone <EOS>
<SOS> thus patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation <EOS>
<SOS> all patients require careful audiometric assessment including promontory stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography additional imaging studies i e magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography are commonly requested <EOS>
<SOS> features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> for the first time the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> ninety six patients with dsm ii r diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field of whom <NUM> had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia were re examined for schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> after an average follow up period of about <NUM> years more than half of the re examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to dsm ii r <EOS>
<SOS> the outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in <NUM> of cases by the presence or absence of self experienced disturbances of perception thought speech or action <EOS>
<SOS> to date at least <NUM> types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis <EOS>
<SOS> a 3 bp deletion in the dyt1 gene causes early onset generalized torsion dystonia td and mutations in the gtp cyclohydrolase i and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa responsive dystonia dyt5 <EOS>
<SOS> a missense change in the d2 dopamine receptor in one large family dyt11 has recently been implicated in myoclonus dystonia <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype dyt6 one form of focal dystonia dyt7 three types of paroxysmal dystonia dyt8 10 x linked dystonia parkinsonism dyt3 and rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism dyt12 <EOS>
<SOS> no positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive td dyt2 and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited td dyt4 <EOS>
<SOS> in addition hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia metabolic and storage disorders and various x linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia <EOS>
<SOS> it may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we investigated whether in conjunction with neuroleptics a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2 year follow up <EOS>
<SOS> this prospective randomized study covered a total of <NUM> schizophrenic patients according to dsm ii r and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations <EOS>
<SOS> patients were examined before immediately after and <NUM> years after the end of the intervention <EOS>
<SOS> patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit <EOS>
<SOS> for patients receiving all three treatment conditions there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow up <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that in the mid term a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness <EOS>
<SOS> background cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds <EOS>

<SOS> recently there has been an increase in the prevalent hiv infected population in germany because of declines in progression to aids and death while the number of newly infected patients remains <URL> increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention <EOS>
<SOS> post exposure prophylaxis pep defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an hiv infected person by a route through which transmission is possible is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases <EOS>
<SOS> economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether pep should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for pep should be used for other hiv prevention or treatment <URL> value of pep depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of pep in different population subgroups including those occupationally exposed those exposed through unprotected sex and those exposed through iv drug use <EOS>
<SOS> the cost effectiveness of pep is also compared to literature estimates of the cost effectiveness of other prevention activities <EOS>

<SOS> this paper describes the clinical and mr course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain <EOS>
<SOS> each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art <EOS>
<SOS> however an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain <EOS>
<SOS> in most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself <EOS>
<SOS> mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> apart from classic non opioid analgesics co analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well <EOS>
<SOS> prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> blockades with local anaesthetics as mono therapy of chronic pain are obsolete <EOS>
<SOS> in posttraumatic pain however a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful <EOS>
<SOS> the exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain smp <EOS>
<SOS> effects of <NUM> different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well being in the elderly were meta analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> psychological well being was improved and self rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation <EOS>
<SOS> the mean effect size for other rated depression reached d 1 15 <EOS>
<SOS> whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self rated well being or depression other rated depression improved less in older samples <EOS>
<SOS> high effect sizes derived from control enhancing interventions and behavior therapy <EOS>
<SOS> sub analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting <EOS>
<SOS> higher therapeutic qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect sizes too <EOS>
<SOS> implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed <EOS>

<SOS> the tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout <EOS>
<SOS> before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about <NUM> 60 of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits <EOS>
<SOS> clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed <EOS>
<SOS> however the presence of degenerative tissues as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals <EOS>

<SOS> hiv 1 associated encephalopathy hive remains an important manifestation of advanced hiv infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy <EOS>
<SOS> this is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system cns <EOS>
<SOS> hive is characterized by a subcortical dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits <EOS>
<SOS> an invariable finding are deficits of central motor function <EOS>
<SOS> pathogenetically an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent cns cells is believed to be a requirement <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection <EOS>

<SOS> forty nine patients mean age <NUM> years admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry <EOS>
<SOS> the mean follow up was <NUM> months range 19 54 months <EOS>
<SOS> the deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure <EOS>
<SOS> using a clinical score most of the patients had satisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> the plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non satisfactory results <EOS>

<SOS> bone fracture soft tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients and these patients are known to be immunocompromised <EOS>
<SOS> nonetheless it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting <EOS>
<SOS> to determine this experimentally closed bone fracture right lower leg and or soft tissue trauma 2 5 cm midline laparotomy were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock mean arterial bp of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mm hg for <NUM> min in male c3h hen mice <EOS>
<SOS> all animals were killed at <NUM> h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically <EOS>
<SOS> more significant depression of splenocyte il 2 and il 3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> the present study suggests that different traumatic insults i e bone fracture as well as soft tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock produce comparable depression of host immune function <EOS>
<SOS> moreover combination of closed bone fracture and soft tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity <EOS>
<SOS> this indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> the markedly depressed immune function following bony injury soft tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation <EOS>
<SOS> in the management of acute major vessel occlusion the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator rt pa urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted <EOS>
<SOS> today the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction lung embolism ischaemic stroke deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach <EOS>
<SOS> basically it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk <EOS>
<SOS> since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion crao or central retinal vein occlusion crvo should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place <EOS>
<SOS> in this article we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes <EOS>
<SOS> moreover we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt pa in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> in light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution we believe that the administration of low dose rt pa 50 mg in a frontloaded manner simultaneous administration of rt pa and intravenous heparin constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion crao or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion rvo recent onset of symptoms crao <NUM> h rvo <NUM> d and severe visual loss 20 50 <EOS>
<SOS> because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease <EOS>

<SOS> confluent and reticulated papillomatosis crp is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology <EOS>
<SOS> recent electron microscopic studies suggest that crp is a disorder of keratinisation <EOS>
<SOS> in our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings <EOS>
<SOS> crp is generally resistant to therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we treated a 19 year old patient with typical crp with oral minocycline <EOS>
<SOS> within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely <EOS>
<SOS> a mild relapse <NUM> months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline <EOS>
<SOS> twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> in crp minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects <EOS>

<SOS> the aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate for the first time whether the dose of <NUM> µg pge1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients with intermittent claudication and a pain free walking distance between <NUM> and <NUM> m 3 km h 12 were randomized to receive an i v <EOS>
<SOS> infusion of <NUM> ampoules prostavasin 60 µg pge1 administered for either <NUM> or <NUM> h once a day for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> primary variables were pain free walking distance as well as safety determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy was comparable in the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> in the 1 h infusion group the pain free walking distance increased from <NUM> to <NUM> m and in the 2 h group from <NUM> to <NUM> m while the absolute walking distance increased from <NUM> to <NUM> m and from <NUM> to <NUM> m respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the differences between the two groups were not significant although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain free walking distances of less than <NUM> m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2 h pge1 infusion increase in walking distance <NUM> m as compared with <NUM> m <EOS>
<SOS> course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> altogether in intermittent claudication both the 1 h and the 2 h pge1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety <EOS>
<SOS> patients with an initial pain free walking distance of less than <NUM> m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2 h pge1 infusion <EOS>

<SOS> the posterior cruciate ligament pcl is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint <EOS>
<SOS> its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area <EOS>
<SOS> the posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles <EOS>
<SOS> from a functional point of view one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur <EOS>
<SOS> the anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone <EOS>
<SOS> these fibers become tense when the knee is flexed <EOS>
<SOS> the posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended <EOS>
<SOS> the main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type i collagen positive dense connective tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the longitudinal fibrils of type i collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type ii collagen positive fibrils <EOS>
<SOS> in the center of the middle third region the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament <EOS>
<SOS> in this region the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage <EOS>
<SOS> oval shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils <EOS>
<SOS> the femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis <EOS>
<SOS> near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint <EOS>
<SOS> the blood supply of the pcl arises from the middle geniculate artery <EOS>
<SOS> the ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network <EOS>

<SOS> after elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism n as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome fms or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism <EOS>
<SOS> fms and pain patients score high on depression anxiety and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> high subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high n subjects and fms patients <EOS>
<SOS> on the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with crh as well as prolactin responses to trh are higher in fms patients than in high n healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference <EOS>
<SOS> a common feature however is the lack of adapatability in the two groups since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other waking sleeping working relaxing to re adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses or to adjust to conditions of shift work <EOS>
<SOS> this is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in fms patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain producing muscle tension <EOS>

<SOS> modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and at the same time satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth <EOS>
<SOS> standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications <EOS>
<SOS> a considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical technical image associated with modern obstetrics <EOS>
<SOS> the benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application <EOS>
<SOS> there is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> in a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events <EOS>

<SOS> the diagnoses were confirmed by histology concomitant diseases especially diabetes mellitus were not detectable <EOS>
<SOS> following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse <EOS>
<SOS> hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol <EOS>

<SOS> more severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis <EOS>
<SOS> this is followed by a consequent physical therapy joint and soft tissue techniques and anti inflammatory drugs <EOS>
<SOS> the goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint the improvement of the coordination and the proprioception <EOS>
<SOS> the chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions <EOS>
<SOS> local ice application sytemic and local anti inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> soft heel shock absorber elastic and semi rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement <EOS>
<SOS> synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis <EOS>
<SOS> radiosynoviorthesis rso which is an alternative in certain cases has been performed with great success in <NUM> cases in our hospital <EOS>
<SOS> in advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> bandages crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity <EOS>
<SOS> over an 18 month period findings of stress x ray of the ankle and medical records of <NUM> cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications results and therapeutic consequences <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress x ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions <EOS>
<SOS> a 72 year old patient received <NUM> mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1 5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy <EOS>
<SOS> severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened <NUM> h later which lasted over the next <NUM> h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> continuous administration of 6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is condition was not normalized until a single dose of <NUM> mg flumazenil was administered <EOS>
<SOS> for the time being especially in the case of elderly patients we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than <NUM> mg morphine is given <EOS>
<SOS> respiration should be monitored for quite some time <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the often debated nyha classification the determination of peak oxygen uptake peak vo2 by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure chf <EOS>
<SOS> however cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell <EOS>
<SOS> exercise capacity can also be determined by the <NUM> minute walk test <EOS>
<SOS> this test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within <NUM> minutes <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore it can be easily performed and due to low logistic and personal requirements it is very cost effective <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the <NUM> minute walk test as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing are influenced by extracardial exercise limiting disorders such as pulmonary diseases <EOS>
<SOS> independent from the etiology of chf the results of the <NUM> minute walk test are closely related to peak vo2 <EOS>
<SOS> in serial exercise testing the distance covered within <NUM> minutes allow to predict the individual peak vo2 <EOS>
<SOS> like peak vo2 the <NUM> minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in chf with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters <EOS>
<SOS> in chf patients a walking distance <NUM> m is associated with a one year mortality of up to 50 whereas the one year mortality in patients reaching a walking distance <NUM> m amounts to only a few percent <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of <NUM> m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance <NUM> m like cardiopulmonary exercise testing the <NUM> minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> minute walk test is thus a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in chf patients <EOS>
<SOS> however neither the <NUM> minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients e g for cardiac transplantation as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters <EOS>
<SOS> we report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the german literature <EOS>
<SOS> for over a year a 16 year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular papulo vesicular eruption on the trunk axillae and pubic region <EOS>
<SOS> histologically a superficial <NUM> perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid <NUM> inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed <EOS>
<SOS> topical corticosteroids and <NUM> systemic antihistamines had no effect <EOS>
<SOS> systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone dadps produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> healing <NUM> occurred only after <NUM> weeks of systemic minocycline <EOS>
<SOS> following parenteral administration clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels <EOS>
<SOS> patient controlled analgesia pca makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo facial surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the effects of glycerol are discussed in detail <EOS>
<SOS> glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states <EOS>
<SOS> especially if applied in oil water emulsions it improves the hydration of the horny layers better than urea <EOS>
<SOS> in addition if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore by using glycerol the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced long term used leads to increased elasticity <EOS>
<SOS> the roughness of the horny layer is reduced which can be explained by the abrasive and or the hydrating effect <EOS>
<SOS> glycerol used in o w emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents <EOS>
<SOS> presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier <EOS>
<SOS> finally <NUM> glycerol can lead similarly to urea to an improvement in active agent penetration as has been proven for hexylnicotinate <EOS>
<SOS> background an 18 year old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus <EOS>
<SOS> she complained of diplopia on lateral gaze <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory investigations confirmed grave is disease with hyperthyroidism and tsh receptor antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients <EOS>
<SOS> the safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied <EOS>
<SOS> internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non pharmacological treatment option <EOS>
<SOS> cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process <EOS>
<SOS> recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts <EOS>
<SOS> thus mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> plasmocytic non hodgkin is lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia proteinuria anemia and hypercalcemia <EOS>
<SOS> in its progress deposits of amyloids in <NUM> almost all organs can be observed <EOS>
<SOS> however plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare <EOS>
<SOS> this case report presents a 61 year old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations <EOS>
<SOS> a biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light chain type which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light chains stage ii after durie and salmon <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro enteric system <EOS>
<SOS> macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature <EOS>
<SOS> however reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known <EOS>
<SOS> aim improved detection of pulmonary venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay <EOS>
<SOS> for the histological verification of suspicious non palpable small breast tumors the three dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system is the optimal solution at present <EOS>
<SOS> because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided <EOS>
<SOS> taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration suspicious microcalcification focal shadow and structural irregularity it can be stated that the digital mammography of the abbi system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique <EOS>
<SOS> these structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography <EOS>
<SOS> after the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin r1 resection <EOS>
<SOS> thirteen invasive and <NUM> intraductal carcinomas were found in <NUM> cases of cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> procedures carried out to exclude an in breast recurrence <NUM> intraductal carcinomas and <NUM> invasive carcinoma were observed <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> invasive carcinomas and in <NUM> of <NUM> intraductal carcinomas breast conserving therapy was indicated <EOS>
<SOS> two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied minimal tumor free margin <NUM> mm no extensive intraductal component to use the abbi cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow <EOS>
<SOS> with the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease chd accurate and frequent follow up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed up <NUM> fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged <NUM> years <MOB> years for <NUM> years <MOB> years <EOS>
<SOS> it is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome like age at injury type of fracture interval between injury and treatment method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up subjective parameters pain weather sensitiveness clinical parameters range of motion claudication leg length discrepancies and radiological parameters hip series were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol <EOS>
<SOS> 29 of <NUM> children 96 7 have sustained displaced fractures <EOS>
<SOS> non operative treatment has been applied in <NUM> children <EOS>
<SOS> 26 femoral neck fractures type i 1 type ii 8 type ii 17 were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and or pins <EOS>
<SOS> following non operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> following operative treatment <NUM> of <NUM> children 34 6 sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and <NUM> children 11 5 suffered a coxa vara <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> children 23 we observed leg length discrepancies <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type ii or type ii fractures or between the groups of children aged <NUM> years when compared to children aged <NUM> years or between the group of children who were operated on within <NUM> hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated <NUM> hours after the accident <EOS>
<SOS> we observed no significant follow up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing <EOS>
<SOS> operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children <EOS>
<SOS> however in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation interval injury operation <NUM> hours when compared to children who had been operated <NUM> hours after the injury <EOS>
<SOS> evidence based standards for structure quality in out patient management of chronic pain states do not exist <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain <EOS>
<SOS> objective the aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver venous oxygen saturation oxygen delivery and demand liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects <NUM> in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus <EOS>
<SOS> facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents <EOS>
<SOS> due to this main etiologic factor trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries commonly involving the brain chest or abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life threatening injuries including the maintenance of the airways <EOS>
<SOS> patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures <EOS>
<SOS> a complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods <EOS>
<SOS> a series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography ct <EOS>
<SOS> in trauma patients ct is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality <EOS>
<SOS> ct delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies <EOS>
<SOS> a complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological ct evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds surgery rates and small area variations within the catchment area of the aok magdeburg were examined for the year <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> substantial variation can be constantly seen <EOS>
<SOS> the extremal quotient at the <NUM> most frequent icpm groups ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> generally the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute <EOS>
<SOS> correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of the small area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates <EOS>

<SOS> without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn <EOS>
<SOS> only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published <EOS>
<SOS> a critical review of these studies and some case reports in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations <EOS>
<SOS> we report on unusual presentation forms of pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with aids <EOS>
<SOS> a 36 years old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x ray <EOS>
<SOS> the biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells focal recent and older hemorrhages rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications <EOS>
<SOS> in the surrounding tissue there were pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change <EOS>
<SOS> a cytomegalic virus infection was also found <EOS>
<SOS> in aortic atresia coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta <EOS>
<SOS> we report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia <EOS>
<SOS> in one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome aortic atresia severe mitral stenosis an intact interatrial septum premature closure of the foramen ovale was found <EOS>
<SOS> while no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found echocardiography angiography and the post mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> in a second patient with complex congenital heart disease including aortic atresia antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc <EOS>
<SOS> this report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary cameral sinusoids and coronary arterio venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling <EOS>
<SOS> however methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported <EOS>
<SOS> with the advent of a new biosensor chiron diagnostics and a revised nova biomedical device accuracy was expected to be improved <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods <EOS>
<SOS> the combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three dimensional bone architecture <EOS>
<SOS> microcomputed tomography avoids the time consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> thus three dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone <EOS>
<SOS> the aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion which does not occur frequently <EOS>
<SOS> every site of the skeleton may be involved <EOS>
<SOS> although it can be observed at any age it distinctly predominates from <NUM> to <NUM> years of age <EOS>
<SOS> distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist <EOS>
<SOS> since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> in the current retrospective study results of <NUM> surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts thereof <NUM> latent <NUM> active and <NUM> aggressive lesions were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> while morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions a recurrence rate of 19 5 had to be observed in our series <EOS>
<SOS> taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage dependent surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the rs3pe syndrome remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> it usually presents as an acute symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet <EOS>
<SOS> anti inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the case of an <NUM> year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand <EOS>
<SOS> a thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected <EOS>
<SOS> within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand <EOS>
<SOS> movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful <EOS>
<SOS> low dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms <EOS>

<SOS> injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today <EOS>
<SOS> when the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis is increased threefold <EOS>
<SOS> the lethality the overall gravity of the injuries the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased <EOS>
<SOS> even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved long term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist <EOS>
<SOS> complicated pelvic injuries i e pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture floating hip are special cases <EOS>
<SOS> haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy <EOS>
<SOS> even when these priorities are correctly observed the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft tissue damage <EOS>
<SOS> acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures <EOS>
<SOS> operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned such fracture specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall comminuted fractures joint depression fractures and intra articular fragments increasingly play a part <EOS>

<SOS> by using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory cochlear hl <EOS>
<SOS> we prefer distortion product otoacoustic emissions dpoae because these are more frequency specific and stable <EOS>
<SOS> from april <NUM> to may 1996 we examined preoperatively <NUM> patients with radiologically proven an <EOS>
<SOS> pure tone audiometry dp grams brainstem evoked response audiometry bera and vestibular studies were performed in all cases while special auditory tests fowler carhart and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> bera was pathological in <NUM> cases and latencies were borderline in one case <EOS>
<SOS> after comparing audiograms and dp grams we found <NUM> patients with sensory hl <NUM> patients with combined sensorineural hl and <NUM> patients with neural hl <EOS>
<SOS> there was a strong correlation between the results of dpoae and the results of special auditory test 0 63 whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function <EOS>
<SOS> the result showed that the typical hl caused by an was a combined sensorineural loss <EOS>
<SOS> dpoae were not suited for the detection of an but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function <EOS>
<SOS> the monoclonal dominant malignant t cells in mycosis fungoides mf carry identical tcr rearrangements <EOS>
<SOS> their detection is a useful diagnostic tool <EOS>
<SOS> thus in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal t cells in skin biopsy samples of mf patients by tcr pcr followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis tgge <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> out of <NUM> mf patients at least one skin sample with sufficient dna quality for pcr analysis was obtained <EOS>
<SOS> applying a consensus pcr for the tcr genes vi and j 1 2 we detected monoclonal t cells in <NUM> cases 65 <EOS>
<SOS> in the remaining <NUM> cases we performed two multiplex pcrs covering rearrangements of the other tcr genes <EOS>
<SOS> here we found in <NUM> cases 6 predominant clonal rearrangements of vii iv and j 1 2 and in <NUM> 1 those of vi iv and j p1 2 <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with mf detecting rearrangements of only vi and j 1 2 is sufficient for pcr screening analysis <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the patients 28 the applied methods revealed no monoclonal t cells <EOS>
<SOS> this may be due to a low cell number oligoclonal nature chromosomal abberations or remaining of tcr in germline configuration <EOS>
<SOS> despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our retrospective cross sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection <EOS>
<SOS> the parents of <NUM> hearing impaired children were interviewed <EOS>
<SOS> all children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities <EOS>
<SOS> at an average age of <NUM> months parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment <EOS>
<SOS> on average it then took an additional <NUM> months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation fitting of hearing aids <EOS>
<SOS> significantly total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to hearing loss parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing impaired close relatives as well as first born children tended to be diagnosed later <EOS>
<SOS> to further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> after the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization a symptomatic av fistula developped <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis was confirmed by angiography <EOS>
<SOS> using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils <EOS>
<SOS> this prospective study was designed to compare quality of life life satisfaction and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation htx <EOS>
<SOS> 175 patients were included between february <NUM> and december <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> every six months before and 1 5 3 6 and <NUM> months after htx they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires german sf 36 heart failure and specific transplant symptom list global quality of life assessment munich life quality dimension list expected experienced life changes after htx good command of the german language and a minimum age of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> during data evaluation median me mean m and standard deviation sd were created from individual parameters <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life was rated as very poor by 84 of patients with congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> weeks after htx 74 rated their quality of life as significantly better <EOS>
<SOS> before htx 80 were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87 about physical performance <EOS>
<SOS> six weeks after htx this parameter improved significantly and 76 were very satisfied about their health status and 50 about physical performance <EOS>
<SOS> while somatic changes expected before htx corresponded well with experienced ones psychological improvements were smaller than expected but one year after htx they were significant before m 3 66 sd 0 9 range r 3 78 vs <NUM> months postop m 4 61 sd 0 6 r 2 67 p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life correlated before htx best with subjectively rated health r 0 61 p0 01 and <NUM> months after with satisfaction about health status r 0 76 p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> only in 25 were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity satisfaction professional situation and recreational activities <EOS>
<SOS> 90 of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints most by effects of immunsuppression but were coping well <EOS>
<SOS> the study shows that already <NUM> weeks after successful htx all quality of life parameters improved significantly <EOS>
<SOS> despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints the postoperative life situation of htx patients appeared significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> sevoflurane is a new volatile inhaled anaesthetic <EOS>
<SOS> owing to its lower blood gas solubility coefficient emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane enflurane or halothane <EOS>
<SOS> sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations ifcs in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day <EOS>
<SOS> background rarely an additional brown is syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy <EOS>
<SOS> surgical measures are controversial and problematic <EOS>
<SOS> metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages <EOS>
<SOS> one of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion <EOS>
<SOS> proteolysis of the extracellular matrix as well as increased locomotion leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells <EOS>
<SOS> in the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium extravasate and form metastases <EOS>
<SOS> finally neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to the conclusion that anti proteolytic and anti angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth <EOS>
<SOS> whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint <EOS>
<SOS> urodynamic examinations were performed in <NUM> patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy <EOS>
<SOS> a significant decrease in bladder capacity 396 ml to <NUM> ml urethral closure pressure 89 6 cm h2o to 65 2 cm h2o and functional profile length 61 mm to <NUM> mm was noted <EOS>
<SOS> the continence rate after radical prostatectomy was <NUM> after <NUM> month <NUM> after <NUM> months <NUM> after <NUM> months and <NUM> after <NUM> months respectively <EOS>
<SOS> a correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence <EOS>
<SOS> a second urodynamic examination was performed <NUM> months after radical prostatectomy <EOS>
<SOS> functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased <EOS>
<SOS> these data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters <EOS>
<SOS> we are interested in the interaction of high energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper <EOS>
<SOS> the preliminary results give reason to hope as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound accessible tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects <EOS>
<SOS> recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online <EOS>
<SOS> the capability of mri to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach <EOS>
<SOS> the role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates or complete or partial closure of a growth plate <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to fractures of the upper extremities spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm <EOS>
<SOS> in the context of the quality assurance program of the german pension insurance institutions instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure process and results of inpatient rehabilitation as well as patient satisfaction <EOS>
<SOS> the routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice so that concepts of treatment and in the long run effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved <EOS>
<SOS> when the quality profiles of rehabilitation hospitals are compared benchmarking paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost quality ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> in the present article results of a first field run of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported <EOS>
<SOS> a comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> in several subdimensions of patient satisfaction however significant differences between hospitals were found <EOS>
<SOS> quality of rehabilitation processes as assessed by a standardized peer review varied substantially between <NUM> hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation e g in the history and diagnosis of disabilities in the consideration of psycho social problems or in the assessment of occupational capacities <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis of thr failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement <EOS>
<SOS> the acetabular cup fails more often than the stem <EOS>
<SOS> in the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups <EOS>
<SOS> the known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially <NUM> to <NUM> years after implantation could of course not be seen in this study <EOS>
<SOS> the success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis age over <NUM> and the fixation manner the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the zweymüller cup as well as the link type v cup showed good results <EOS>
<SOS> the midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique <EOS>
<SOS> some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results <EOS>
<SOS> the further implantation should be thought of what partially has already happened <EOS>
<SOS> the results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks age under 60 <EOS>
<SOS> type i and type ii diabetes are the most common types of diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> the ratio of type i to type ii diabetes is about <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> type i diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin dependent <URL> disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence juvenile diabetes although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed <EOS>
<SOS> morphologically a subtotal <NUM> to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs <EOS>
<SOS> lymphocytic insulitis which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed is pathognomonic of type i diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> this insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors <EOS>
<SOS> an important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition hla dr3 dr4 dq8 in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors e g viruses <EOS>
<SOS> autoantibodies such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies ica insulin autoantibodies iaa and or autoantibodies to the gaba synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase gad are already detectable in a prediabetic phase although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion <EOS>
<SOS> the course of the disease is dependent on age <EOS>
<SOS> young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults <EOS>
<SOS> this article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome osas in children <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence of this disorder in 4 6 year old children is 0 7 <EOS>
<SOS> leading clinical sign in 90 of patients is habitual snoring but this is rather nonspecific as 60 of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have osas <EOS>
<SOS> other signs such as daytime sleepiness failure to thrive profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis therefore has to be confirmed by polysomnography where osas is suggested by the occurrence of 5 obstructive apneas hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a co2 of 50 mmhg for 8 of sleep time and or 1 desaturation to 90 h <EOS>
<SOS> patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun and patients come to accept the inevitability of death <EOS>
<SOS> this can lead to a unique highly emotional situation with direct or indirect open or hidden varied and very personal manifestations <EOS>
<SOS> the dermatological clinic in homburg was founded in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> it was integrated into the saarland university as a dermatology department <EOS>
<SOS> a review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology as well as new developments in related basic research during the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial <EOS>
<SOS> we report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery <EOS>
<SOS> a 33 year old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with fsh hcg for in vitro fertilization <EOS>
<SOS> she developed a transient left hemiparesis <EOS>
<SOS> this was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery <EOS>
<SOS> open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife <EOS>
<SOS> now we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the results are based on the analysis of a large population of <NUM> patients with the occupation housewife and the diagnosis eczema who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the information network of departments of dermatology ivdk <EOS>
<SOS> data for hiv infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality <EOS>
<SOS> estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk <EOS>
<SOS> extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from us seroincidence studies may be seriously biased <EOS>
<SOS> infectivity of and susceptibility to hiv may be influenced by concomitant stds antiretroviral therapy alloimmunization and or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter and intraindividual variability <EOS>
<SOS> differences in factors influencing transmission probability of hiv most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of hiv <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and march 1997 <NUM> patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means median age <NUM> years <NUM> f <NUM> m <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients 17 f <NUM> m a clinical and radiological follow up median <NUM> months range 6 106 could be obtained <EOS>
<SOS> additionally a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients <EOS>

<SOS> 18 had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity <EOS>
<SOS> hill sachs lesions were identified in <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in <NUM> by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> no relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found p 0 95 <EOS>
<SOS> the recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients age <EOS>
<SOS> we analyzed quality assurance protocol records of <NUM> geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on length of stay information los <EOS>
<SOS> doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74 25 of cases to administration data <EOS>
<SOS> 14 47 of cases were registered with different los 11 28 of los information was missing <EOS>
<SOS> the increasing amount of documentation tasks in german geriatric hospitals is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion we assume that not only discrete well known information admission and discharge dates los are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively <EOS>
<SOS> only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated <EOS>
<SOS> in young patients however fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted <EOS>
<SOS> this procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose morscher developed the hook screw which connects the arch with the anterior articular process <EOS>
<SOS> it allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw <EOS>
<SOS> a follow up study of the first <NUM> patients with a follow up time of <NUM> years on average showed a good subjective result in <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> in patients younger than <NUM> years of age however the result was good in <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> the reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk <EOS>
<SOS> direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after <NUM> months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> after the end of growth an mri study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not <EOS>
<SOS> direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> after the age of <NUM> years this procedure should not be carried out <EOS>
<SOS> we are presenting a 47 year old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of thailand <EOS>
<SOS> immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body <EOS>
<SOS> after a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids <EOS>
<SOS> three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids <EOS>
<SOS> over the next few weeks however a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred <EOS>
<SOS> raised titres of igg and igm antibodies against different jellyfish from the indian and pacific ocean were detected in the patient is serum by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay <EOS>
<SOS> antibodies against bees class 1 and wasps class 4 were found by the radioallergosorbent test <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom <EOS>
<SOS> first aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested <EOS>
<SOS> the design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task <EOS>
<SOS> in particular in icd trials false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial <EOS>
<SOS> identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials <EOS>
<SOS> problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs <EOS>
<SOS> further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared <EOS>
<SOS> technical mistakes as imprecise definitions arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow up <EOS>
<SOS> simple b mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures while color coded duplex sonography ccds additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> more recent technical advances such as power doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation <EOS>
<SOS> the possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the first morphological changes in eyes with hiv infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton wool spots and microaneurysms <EOS>
<SOS> the study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non invasive methods <EOS>
<SOS> the operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations mad is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load bearing <EOS>
<SOS> modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees <EOS>
<SOS> predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases the analysis of the mad does not show any angular deformity but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone <EOS>
<SOS> such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone <EOS>
<SOS> in combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone <EOS>
<SOS> in translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re staggering made by a translation osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy <EOS>
<SOS> in complex deformities with angulation and translation the translation requires a separate corrective planning <EOS>
<SOS> by using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the axis of correction of angulation aca in relation to the n cora of the deformity has to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> if aca position is not conform with the n cora position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur <EOS>
<SOS> these geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods <EOS>
<SOS> possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems <EOS>
<SOS> the employers liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years <EOS>
<SOS> the personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient is inability to work <EOS>
<SOS> the basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them <EOS>
<SOS> meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it <EOS>
<SOS> the objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of germany <EOS>
<SOS> it is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> stroke and its consequences are under medical sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges <EOS>
<SOS> due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase <EOS>
<SOS> nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> only the admission of rt pa in the usa in <NUM> for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then <NUM> hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies <EOS>
<SOS> the good profit risk ratio of early thrombolysis with rt pa could be confirmed by further studies lately <EOS>
<SOS> in the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the aha in the importance of grade a recommendation <EOS>
<SOS> in europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice <EOS>
<SOS> at present only few patients receive such a treatment <EOS>
<SOS> a thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra structure <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention <EOS>
<SOS> therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic <EOS>
<SOS> a 69 year old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus pulmonary artery and left atrium <EOS>
<SOS> using cardiopulmonary bypass an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch <EOS>
<SOS> the lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle <EOS>
<SOS> after a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence <NUM> years postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study we report the indications complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits <EOS>
<SOS> the method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit <EOS>
<SOS> twenty four primary and <NUM> secondary grafts were implanted in <NUM> patients aged <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> in the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing <EOS>
<SOS> all implants became integrated none were lost because of infection or extrusion <EOS>
<SOS> eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma <EOS>
<SOS> in the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures exophthalmometry hertel and measuring the prosthesis motility kestenbaum <EOS>
<SOS> three patients showed fair results all the others had good or very good results <EOS>
<SOS> in one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed <EOS>
<SOS> despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants <EOS>
<SOS> liver tissue from <NUM> female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis pbc stages i iv was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen presenting cells <EOS>
<SOS> dendritic cells dcs were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti s <NUM> protein and kimlp antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> we confirm previous findings that in early pbc s <NUM> protein positive dcs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia <EOS>
<SOS> however the present study disclosed that s <NUM> protein and kimlp positive dcs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses pmns developing in pbc associated chronic hepatitis <EOS>
<SOS> dcs in pmns were observed in all pbc stages but were most prominent in late stage pbc <EOS>
<SOS> these findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in pbc may not be limited to bile ducts but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity <EOS>
<SOS> health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies <EOS>
<SOS> the ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics <EOS>
<SOS> their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care <EOS>
<SOS> due to dwindling resources the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized <EOS>
<SOS> possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention <EOS>
<SOS> if emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission however observing standards of medical practice legal provisions and the given framework of society they must not surrender to pure cost containment <EOS>
<SOS> we performed a phase ii trial with second line chemotherapy in patients with refractory metastatic cancer of the bladder <EOS>
<SOS> second line therapy consists of <NUM> cycles of mitomycin c 5 fluorouracil and folic acid <EOS>
<SOS> two patients suffered from who grade ii side effects nephrotoxicity leukocytopenia <EOS>
<SOS> we did not find any complete or partial remission <EOS>
<SOS> four patients had a stable disease <NUM> months after therapy patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> four patients reported an improvement in quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> since all patients received supportive care improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion second line chemotherapy with mitomycin c 5 fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate based chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § <NUM> of the penal code nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view <EOS>
<SOS> the many strands of the movement in favour of making death on demand exempt from punishment in germany as it is in the netherlands cannot change this <EOS>
<SOS> the oral retinoid etretinate tigason has recently been replaced by trans acitretin neotigason in the treatment of severe psoriasis primarily because of its short half life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required <EOS>
<SOS> after introduction of the new drug however circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans acitretin <EOS>
<SOS> thus far re esterification has been detected in at least <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the 2 month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans acitretin has been extended to <NUM> years as with etretinate <EOS>
<SOS> we review some aspects of trans acitretin metabolism with special emphasis on etretinate formation <EOS>
<SOS> re esterification of trans acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients as well as in animal models <EOS>
<SOS> ethanol is a co factor for the enzymatic re esterification of trans acitretin <EOS>
<SOS> it is unclear whether the introduction of trans acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients <EOS>
<SOS> monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament acl ruptures in athletes <EOS>
<SOS> during <NUM> and 1990 <NUM> athletes with acl ruptures were treated in our sports surgery department and <NUM> of them were suitable for inclusion in the study <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of acl rupture had been <NUM> made <EOS>
<SOS> group i n 129 underwent acl reconstruction using free bone patellar tendon bone autografts while group ii n 92 received conservative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we were able to evaluate <NUM> patients during follow up 42 from group i and <NUM> from group ii <EOS>
<SOS> the average follow up period was <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients age sex or level of sports activity <EOS>
<SOS> follow up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> during follow up we used ikdc and oak scores to evaluate the results <EOS>
<SOS> we found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high risk pivoting sports but there was no difference if the patients were in the low risk or no risk pivoting group of athletes <EOS>
<SOS> concerning reoperation and early arthrosis the difference was significant between the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> background by depletion of stratospheric ozone enhanced levels of uv radiation reach the surface of the earth <EOS>
<SOS> exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to uv radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength mri unit 0 2 t esaote biomedica and a high field strength mri unit 1 5 t siemens in detecting meniscal lesions <EOS>
<SOS> twenty patients were investigated on a 0 2 t low field mri unit and a 1 5 t high field mri unit for meniscal lesions <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus for a total of <NUM> observations <EOS>
<SOS> the reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three point scale <EOS>
<SOS> investigations of the high field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in <NUM> patients and ruled out a tear in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in <NUM> observations and with moderate confidence in <NUM> observations <EOS>
<SOS> investigations of the low field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in <NUM> patients and ruled out tears in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in <NUM> observations with moderate confidence in <NUM> observations and with low confidence in <NUM> observations <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis in high and low field images was identical in <NUM> of cases in one patient observations from the high field unit changed the therapeutic management <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength mr imaging <EOS>
<SOS> low field strength mr imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging however we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high field mr imaging <EOS>
<SOS> the past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of drug resistance mechanisms the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance <EOS>
<SOS> the experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors such as p glycoprotein multidrug resistance associated protein topoisomerase or glutathione s transferase in urologic malignancies is now relatively comprehensive allowing for an initial analysis <EOS>
<SOS> clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity <EOS>
<SOS> we expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future <EOS>
<SOS> a study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> impacted lower wisdom teeth and <NUM> impacted lower second molars were removed in <NUM> patients all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> clinical radiological and surgical factors of each case were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination <EOS>
<SOS> follow up was carried out for a maximum of <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3 57 <EOS>
<SOS> the lingual nerve was injured in 2 1 of patients <EOS>
<SOS> most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0 91 and of the lingual nerve in 0 37 <EOS>
<SOS> however the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general <EOS>
<SOS> the effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> for the inferior alveolar nerve analysis revealed significant effects in older patients for completely developed roots for deeply impacted teeth in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal for difficult surgery and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve <EOS>
<SOS> the surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> background this review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of chronic low back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed because the validity specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of yersinia infections in children <EOS>
<SOS> this is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> we found specific antibodies against yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat edly in the patients serum <EOS>
<SOS> only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for <NUM> weeks we observed a recovery of our patient <EOS>
<SOS> the present study investigates patients expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements <EOS>
<SOS> fifty five patients with tumors of different sites 30 with previous tumor related surgery <NUM> without surgery admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire eortc qlq c30 plc by siegrist et al therapy related expectations and success before and after inpatient radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> the corresponding physician ratings were collected <EOS>
<SOS> fifty eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal healing whereas from the physician is standpoint this was realistic in only <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> the specific radiotherapy related expectations tumor control and pain relief reached almost the same levels in patients and physician 71 vs <NUM> and <NUM> vs <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy 53 4 vs <NUM> patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life 37 1 vs <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year n 18 showed a particularly high healing expectancy 83 whereas patients whose operation dated back more than <NUM> year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal 83 <EOS>
<SOS> the surgeon as the primary contact person for patients can influence patients therapy related expectations <EOS>
<SOS> in explaining the overall therapeutic strategy surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies <EOS>
<SOS> the meanings of the terms quality quality of care and quality management were clarified with common international definitions <EOS>
<SOS> based on that the basic ideas concepts and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained <EOS>
<SOS> finally some future trends related to quality were viewed which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome ppgss was first described in <NUM> by harms et al <EOS>
<SOS> the syndrome is characterised by fever an itchy erythema with edema confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a gloves and socks distribution <EOS>
<SOS> the skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> viral infections in particular parvovirus b19 are the most likely trigger <EOS>
<SOS> in the present case ppgss developed after taking trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole <EOS>
<SOS> since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re challenge with the same drug this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of ppgss <EOS>
<SOS> most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> on rare occasions malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered <EOS>
<SOS> in four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity <EOS>
<SOS> in all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> the deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> in preoperative x ray studies the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between <NUM> and <NUM> cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle <EOS>
<SOS> all patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up was <NUM> <NUM> years postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the functional outcome was evaluated using the constant murley and the ucla score <EOS>
<SOS> all patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity <EOS>
<SOS> the shoulder function rapidly improved and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients <EOS>
<SOS> if there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results <EOS>
<SOS> as the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial <EOS>
<SOS> although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern <EOS>
<SOS> indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified <EOS>
<SOS> complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions <EOS>
<SOS> the skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible <EOS>
<SOS> the continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies <EOS>
<SOS> background the mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease <EOS>
<SOS> the cross linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect <EOS>
<SOS> in the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54 year old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor spindle cell neoplasia was seen <EOS>
<SOS> no clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible <EOS>
<SOS> after resection of the right upper lobe of the lung including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> this was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene ema and of vimentin <EOS>
<SOS> extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization <EOS>
<SOS> this case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle cell tumor of the lung apart from frequent sarcoma metastases the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> formerly surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard <EOS>
<SOS> improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis <EOS>
<SOS> a considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy <EOS>
<SOS> pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis as results with regard to morbidity mortality and long term outcome are unsatisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage <EOS>
<SOS> in experienced hands all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> this can be achieved by means of prospective long term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical radiological biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods das radiological score adl score hanover or health assessment questionnaire sf36 etc <EOS>
<SOS> long term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in ratingen for <NUM> years without even knowing the term quality management <EOS>
<SOS> quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology orthopedic surgery physiotherapy ergotherapy special care psychological and social services close cooperation with specialists in neurology dermatology ophthalmology etc department of radiology special laboratory facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> the hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors selection training and motivation of the hospital staff supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians daily x ray demonstrations and case reports interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation team reports regular education including review of actual literature for physicians education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses and regular education programs for patients <EOS>
<SOS> process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient whose opinion must be noted and regarded <EOS>
<SOS> as far as possible the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her him in the outpatient clinic <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication side effects efficacy documentation of clinical biochemical radiological and functional data <EOS>
<SOS> decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow up data <EOS>
<SOS> a standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in germany <EOS>
<SOS> two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia aml and acute lymphoblastic leukemia all had initially focal then generalized seizures of short duration <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed in one case minor parietal cortical and subcortical increased signal on t2 weighted images <EOS>
<SOS> in a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found <EOS>
<SOS> although chemotherapy was continued a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> we consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic tapeworm echinococcus <EOS>
<SOS> the larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body most frequently in the liver <EOS>
<SOS> primary bone location is very rare accounting for less than <NUM> of all hydatid lesions <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a case of left sided extended pelvic infestation <EOS>
<SOS> the destruction of the hip joint os pubis large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary <EOS>
<SOS> recurrence of a hydatid cyst <NUM> years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement <EOS>
<SOS> because of instability the primarily inserted polyacetal pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom made device fabricated with the aid of computer aided design cad techniques <EOS>
<SOS> this surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy mebendazole <EOS>
<SOS> the necessity of radical resection in osseus hydatid disease is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> at present phosphodiesterase ii inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states <EOS>
<SOS> despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia elevation of transaminases abdominal disregulation and excessive periphereal vasodilatation <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects <EOS>
<SOS> one of them enoximone marion merrell dow fig <EOS>
<SOS> 1 an imidazole derivative has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function <EOS>
<SOS> in addition in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent <EOS>
<SOS> recently a new substance r80122 janssen belgium fig <EOS>
<SOS> 1 was developed <EOS>
<SOS> first experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and r80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> the extremely rare finding of a proximal radio ulnar synostosis in a <NUM> years old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented <EOS>
<SOS> despite the elbow is being fixed at <NUM> <NUM> ° pronation the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function <EOS>
<SOS> the difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> ischemic preconditioning ip using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische mia represents a new approach in reducing ischemia induced skeletal muscle damage <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ip on skeletal muscle function after <NUM> h ischemia and <NUM> h reperfusion in a rodent model <EOS>
<SOS> ip protocols using one two or three preconditioning cycles of <NUM> min ischemia and <NUM> min reperfusion each were compared to non preconditioned controls <EOS>
<SOS> ip was found to significantly improve force performance endurance and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of ip induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles <EOS>
<SOS> preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles <EOS>
<SOS> altogether this study describes the efficacy of ip in improving post ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one ip cycle to achieve this improvement <EOS>
<SOS> the respective clinical potential warrants further exploration <EOS>
<SOS> pachyonychia congenita pc is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression <EOS>
<SOS> the condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait <EOS>
<SOS> several classifications of pc have been proposed <EOS>
<SOS> feinstein and colleagues suggested four clinical types of pc <EOS>
<SOS> type ii the jackson lawler syndrome is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis <EOS>
<SOS> we report two patients father and son with jackson lawler syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita <EOS>
<SOS> aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described zytogenetic and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility <EOS>
<SOS> the isochromosome i 12p represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ <EOS>
<SOS> a number of proto oncogenes cyclin d and pthlh as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p however their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet <EOS>
<SOS> clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors <EOS>
<SOS> although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers tumor suppressor genes proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators <EOS>
<SOS> investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease <EOS>
<SOS> after laparoscopic cholecystectomy carbon dioxide co2 must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity <EOS>
<SOS> there is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative co2 resorption <EOS>
<SOS> without continuous postoperative monitoring after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to co2 resorption <EOS>
<SOS> studies exist on the course of end expiratory co2 peco2 alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of co2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of co2 metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> after giving informed consent to the study which was approved by the local ethics committee <NUM> patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy <EOS>
<SOS> all patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> after induction total iv anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl propofol and atracurium <EOS>
<SOS> patients were ventilated with oxygen in air fio2 0 4 <EOS>
<SOS> the intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> mm hg <EOS>
<SOS> thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum kp co2 elimination v co2 oxygen uptake v o2 and respiratory quotient rq were measured every minute for <NUM> h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor deltatrac according to the principle of canopy <EOS>
<SOS> assuming an unchanged metabolism the co2 resorption v co2 at any given time t can be calculated from v co2 t v co2 t rq preop v o2 t <EOS>
<SOS> it was thus necessary to define the patient is metabolism on the day of operation <EOS>
<SOS> the first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15 min period <EOS>
<SOS> measuring point <NUM> was determined after exsufflation of the kp and emptying of the remaining co2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery <EOS>
<SOS> patient is tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started <NUM> min after release of the kp for <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> simultaneously a nasal side stream capnometry probe was placed and the peco2 and respiratory frequency rf were obtained by the capnomac ultima datex and registered every minute as well <EOS>
<SOS> values were averaged over four periods of <NUM> min each <EOS>
<SOS> an arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15 min period <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well being <EOS>
<SOS> all data were analysed by the friedman or wilcoxon test p0 05 was considered significant <EOS>
<SOS> the findings do not indicate co2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy tables <NUM> and 3 fig <EOS>
<SOS> arterial co2 as well as peco2 were elevated postoperatively 45 mm hg vs <NUM> mm hg intraoperatively while v co2 and v o2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative rf was comparable to preoperative values <EOS>
<SOS> calculated co2 was lower than <NUM> ml min and within accuracy of measurements <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative pain index ranged between <NUM> and 4 and <NUM> <NUM> mg piritramid was administered <EOS>
<SOS> all patients feld tired immediately after the operation but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60 min period of metabolic monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> there is no significant resorption of co2 from the abdominal cavity later than <NUM> min after releasing the kp <EOS>
<SOS> up to this time any co2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled <EOS>
<SOS> the gene of the cyclin dependent kinase <NUM> cdk4 inhibitor p16ink4a cdkn2 mts1 has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21 a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> an increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16ink4a in malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16ink4a and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in hiv infected patients is high <EOS>
<SOS> the differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders acute psychiatric symptoms of an hiv associated encephalopathy and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders <EOS>
<SOS> secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging ct mri and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid <EOS>
<SOS> in emergency situations however german law imposes strict regulations especially in the case of sectioned patients <EOS>
<SOS> these medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made <EOS>
<SOS> in simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings patients with sympathetically maintained pain smp affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic vasomotor dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> these findings argue against the notion that smp must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge <EOS>
<SOS> in general they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative transluminal angioplasty ita has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years <EOS>
<SOS> whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature reports on the procedural management of ita are rare <EOS>
<SOS> one of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location <EOS>
<SOS> in the following the technique of ortho and retrograde sheath implantation either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft is described in detail <EOS>
<SOS> by respecting particular standards for sheath introduction ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ita can be kept to a minimum <EOS>
<SOS> the importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of new developments including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon the ideal angioplasty access sheath is as yet not available <EOS>
<SOS> in several cases of lupus erythematosus sle scle dle the koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas scratching effects operation scars contact dermatitis pressure from sock tops application of liquid nitrogen exposure to strong sun light etc <EOS>
<SOS> the interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case <EOS>
<SOS> in sle patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids the koebner phenomenon could not be found while it was detected in patients with generalized dle who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones <EOS>
<SOS> it was not seen in patients with localized dle <EOS>
<SOS> there was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the koebner phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to the histopathogenesis of the koebner phenomenon it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network with expression of adhesion molecules might be involved <EOS>
<SOS> the koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> years <NUM> patients with a total of <NUM> painful ear nodules chondrodermatitis helicis have been treated as follows <EOS>
<SOS> a small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination <EOS>
<SOS> the rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser also with local anaesthesia including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules <EOS>
<SOS> there have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection <EOS>
<SOS> new nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way <EOS>
<SOS> there have been no real recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> the cosmetic result is very good in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> the patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy <EOS>
<SOS> laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we represent and discuss etiology diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease <EOS>
<SOS> in the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease <EOS>
<SOS> quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis <EOS>
<SOS> imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion <EOS>
<SOS> as before the evidence of mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis <EOS>
<SOS> despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of mycobacteria even from tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours <EOS>
<SOS> in surgical procedures associated with high blood loss such as vascular and cardiac operations differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders drug induced platelet disorders in particular ass von willebrand is disease and other congenital platelet disorders is effective in minimizing blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance <EOS>
<SOS> therefore simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the case report of a 50 year old woman with stage ii chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post thrombotic syndrome is presented <EOS>
<SOS> progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux <EOS>
<SOS> if conservative treatment fails autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux <EOS>
<SOS> following this report the results and limitations of this method are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders e g alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical system gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> their persistence during full clinical remission however is associated with an increased risk for relapse and thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in order to test this hypothesis we designed a prospective study in which healthy first degree relatives high risk probands hrps n 54 of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine releasing hormone dex crh test and a variety of psychometric scales <EOS>
<SOS> in the present part of the study index assessment these hrps as a group showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the dex crh test outcome furthermore their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing rigidity and autonomic lability <EOS>
<SOS> on a single case level 35 of the hrps were identified as conspicuous depressionlike in at least two of the three areas investigated <EOS>
<SOS> a decision of whether or not this conspicuousness indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow up part of the study has identified those hrps with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime <EOS>
<SOS> undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a <NUM> year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses two miscarriages and myocarditis <EOS>
<SOS> despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders <EOS>
<SOS> iloprost in a dosage of up to <NUM> ng kg min for a total of <NUM> months her <NUM> min walking distance improved from <NUM> to <NUM> m the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from <NUM> to <NUM> dynxsxcm 5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from <NUM> to <NUM> mmhg <EOS>
<SOS> this partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> in the usa recombinant tissue plasminogen activator rt pa has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke ais within a <NUM> hour time window based on the results of the ninds 1 trial <EOS>
<SOS> only few patients with ais are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms and only 3 of these patients qualify for treatment with rt pa <EOS>
<SOS> therefore only few patients with ais will potentially benefit from therapy with rt pa if ninds criteria are applied <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of the second european australasian acute stroke study ecass ii was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt pa in ais for a <NUM> hour time window <EOS>
<SOS> objective to prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker hla b27 <EOS>
<SOS> the radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the tnm classification uicc was therefore prospectively investigated in <NUM> patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages t1n0 to t4n3 <EOS>
<SOS> the clinically c1 and sonographically c2 evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical staging was correct in <NUM> high in <NUM> low in <NUM> the n stages were correct in <NUM> high in <NUM> low in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the sonographic staging was apparently superior with the t classifications correct in <NUM> high in <NUM> low <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the n stages were correct in <NUM> high in <NUM> low in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the accuracy of combined tn classification rose from clinical <NUM> to <NUM> by sonography <EOS>
<SOS> accompanying inflammations foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures due to little patient discomfort good availability and high accuracy is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging therapy planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions <EOS>
<SOS> standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure chf have not been established <EOS>
<SOS> in the past chf patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment with an ejection fraction between <NUM> and 35 and a peak vo2 between <NUM> and <NUM> ml kg min on average <EOS>
<SOS> for determination of training intensity a vo2 between <NUM> and 70 of peak vo2 and or training heart rate between <NUM> and 80 of peak heart rate was used <EOS>
<SOS> there was also a wide range for frequency between <NUM> and <NUM> times per week and duration of training between <NUM> and <NUM> min per session <EOS>
<SOS> for aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied <EOS>
<SOS> we have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain <EOS>
<SOS> after only three weeks of training the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods <EOS>
<SOS> to determine work rate for work phases of interval training a special steep ramp test was developed <EOS>
<SOS> by analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training both were proven to be tolerable in chf patients even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13 or peak cardiac index not greater than <NUM> l m2 min and peak vo2 less than <NUM> ml kg min <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician <EOS>
<SOS> small t1 and exophytic t1 t2 tumors are suitable for radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> limited lesions t1 t2 can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies <EOS>
<SOS> extensive tumors large t2 t3 are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> when radiation treatment fails surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework t4 can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts <EOS>
<SOS> lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease <EOS>
<SOS> inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases with the exception of early glottic cancer <EOS>
<SOS> induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50 60 mm hg in normotensive subjects <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions <EOS>
<SOS> most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50 in many surgical procedures however some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short acting vasodilators as primary agents nitroprusside nitroglycerine urapidil supplemented by volatile anesthetics isoflurane and or blockers esmolol to improve effect reduce dosage and prevent side effects reflex tachycardia tachyphylaxis rebound hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow i e <EOS>
<SOS> ischaemia of vital organs brain myocardium and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients <EOS>
<SOS> thus major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease <EOS>
<SOS> complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> therefore careful assessment and selection of patients together with consideration of the potential complications appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby beat monitoring are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life <EOS>
<SOS> the interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment <EOS>
<SOS> the mutual regulation of the caregiver infant pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements <EOS>
<SOS> this selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> first experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self regulation are reported <EOS>
<SOS> a 31 year old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before <EOS>
<SOS> the physical examination including sonography of the two fetuses showed no pathological signs <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side using routine precautions pre oxygenation and rapid sequence intubation and was maintained unproblematically <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> min after the onset of surgery hypotension tachycardia and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared <EOS>
<SOS> volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation <EOS>
<SOS> elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement <EOS>
<SOS> the development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was treated successfully with epinephrine antihistamines and corticosteroids prednisolone <EOS>
<SOS> the suspicion of latex related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio allergen sorbent test rast and prick and scratch tests <EOS>
<SOS> the mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation <EOS>
<SOS> the heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> during late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position <EOS>
<SOS> a fall in heart rate was only seen in this period <EOS>
<SOS> a fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> the hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> headaches fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation <EOS>
<SOS> blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women <EOS>
<SOS> however the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position <EOS>
<SOS> the birth weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing <EOS>
<SOS> pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight <EOS>
<SOS> these results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts original salt from the dead sea and sodium chloride <EOS>
<SOS> to address this issue test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for <NUM> minutes prior to ultraviolet b uvb irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> the salt concentrations tested were 1 3 5 and 15 <EOS>
<SOS> tap water followed by uvb and uvb alone served as controls <EOS>
<SOS> erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry <EOS>
<SOS> erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to uvb irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by uvb alone <EOS>
<SOS> the most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water uvb <EOS>
<SOS> the salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5 solutions <EOS>
<SOS> there was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> the results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent uvb irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> this may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by uv irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing <EOS>
<SOS> introduction the aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis e g early elective resection and primary anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> methods the data of <NUM> consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified hinchey classification stages 0 ii <EOS>
<SOS> results within our study group the morbidity was <NUM> n 118 and the mortality was <NUM> n 7 <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> n 425 of all cases and in <NUM> 21 33 of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis stage ii a primary anastomosis was performed <EOS>
<SOS> four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis 0 9 <EOS>
<SOS> no leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage ii diverticulitis <EOS>
<SOS> stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> some <NUM> 94 177 of the patients in stage ii and <NUM> 22 33 of the patients in stage ii had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion prophylactic surgery to avoid life threatening situations including abscess formation or perforation is not possible in many cases <EOS>
<SOS> however especially patients at risk age coexisting illness should undergo early surgery <EOS>
<SOS> primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate whether mri is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined <EOS>
<SOS> tumor staging by ct and mr imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium <EOS>
<SOS> in mri <NUM> out of <NUM> thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy in ct none <EOS>
<SOS> in advanced renal carcinoma mri with gadolinium was superior to ct imaging especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus <EOS>
<SOS> consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by mri which therefore may replace conventional cavography <EOS>
<SOS> children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis c virus hcv during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed <EOS>
<SOS> 90 children born to <NUM> infected mothers were included in our study nine of the mothers were known to be co infected with hiv 1 <EOS>
<SOS> these <NUM> children were first tested within <NUM> days after birth and followed for at least three months <EOS>
<SOS> three of the <NUM> children became infected perinatally with hcv as shown by persistence of antibodies after <NUM> years of life and a positive result in the rt pcr <EOS>
<SOS> one of these <NUM> children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values but is otherwise clinically well likewise the other <NUM> infected children <EOS>
<SOS> 54 of the <NUM> uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year <EOS>
<SOS> cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers <EOS>
<SOS> the membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve rsv <EOS>
<SOS> normally the rsv regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the eustachian and thebesian valve <EOS>
<SOS> any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of rsv as a simple muscle bar a chiari network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane cor triatriatum dexter <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow <EOS>
<SOS> therefore dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters <EOS>
<SOS> however since only few data are available from previous studies we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders cmpds and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study <EOS>
<SOS> apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the isel technique and topoisomerase ii <NUM> expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody ki s1 <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore by determination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling pcna index we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the g2 m phase because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle <EOS>
<SOS> patients with imf pv and et revealed a normal range of apoptosis whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia cml a significant increase could be observed <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand imf and pv were characterized by a raised proliferative activity <EOS>
<SOS> dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index <EOS>
<SOS> in cml and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable but imf and pv showed a significant increase <EOS>
<SOS> survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion our in situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics <EOS>
<SOS> in this context a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome <EOS>
<SOS> in a complex animal model in sheep polydioxanone pds and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital wall defects <EOS>
<SOS> in a long term experiment over <NUM> year polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation <EOS>
<SOS> as soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall <EOS>
<SOS> surgery by three dimensional 3d endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and in special cases in thoracic surgery however it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> we inserted a 3 d endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high frequency jet ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> the studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> due to the rather large 3 d endoscope the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25 2 and 70 9 depending on its size <EOS>
<SOS> the measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters expiratory resistance tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure <EOS>
<SOS> the mean fio2 was <NUM> 0 1 the mean pao2 was <NUM> <NUM> mm hg and the mean paco2 was <NUM> <NUM> mm hg <EOS>
<SOS> the mean airway pressure was <NUM> <NUM> mm hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and <NUM> <NUM> mm hg after insertion <EOS>
<SOS> the mean positive end expiratory pressure values increased from <NUM> <NUM> to <NUM> <NUM> mm hg <EOS>
<SOS> reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes <EOS>
<SOS> in the clinical application of 3 d endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation inspection of the surgical field and performance of the surgical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> a co2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime <EOS>
<SOS> although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery it is presently possible to safely use the 3 d endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice improving microsurgery of the larynx <EOS>
<SOS> kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips <EOS>
<SOS> the cystic duct was fixed and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered <EOS>
<SOS> the median values of the six investigated clips ranged between <NUM> n and <NUM> n with a highly significant difference p 0 001 kruskal wallis anova <EOS>
<SOS> in detail both resorbable clips polydioxanone polyglyconate polyglycol acetate were superior to the four titanium clips p 0 005 wilcoxon test <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips <EOS>
<SOS> hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to o2 transport and especially the effective o2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock <EOS>
<SOS> the hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications <EOS>
<SOS> this results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half life of about 8 24 h an adequate o2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity <EOS>
<SOS> a degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of this hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans <EOS>
<SOS> fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of o2 and co2 <EOS>
<SOS> the capacity for the release of o2 to the tissues is especially excellent <EOS>
<SOS> this was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation <EOS>
<SOS> perflubron the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> launch is expected within the next few years <EOS>
<SOS> the new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood gas and tissue blood partition coefficients so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in acute coronary syndromes arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density <EOS>
<SOS> the underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear <EOS>
<SOS> among others increased programmed cell death apoptosis is postulated <EOS>
<SOS> coronary atherectomy specimens from <NUM> patients with unstable angina group 1 and from <NUM> patients with stable angina group 2 were examined using immunohistochemistry tunel test to detect fragmented dna and transmission electron microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition to detect and quantify cell death and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> on occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in russia in the years from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> these operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation <EOS>
<SOS> this work pioneered by russian scientist s brukhonenko and the surgeon n terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public <EOS>
<SOS> the first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than <NUM> operations on the valves of the open heart the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism and principles of open heart surgery stated by n terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time <EOS>
<SOS> in the authors opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery <EOS>
<SOS> aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare <EOS>
<SOS> the literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations <EOS>
<SOS> in the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media <EOS>
<SOS> due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible <EOS>
<SOS> subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms <EOS>
<SOS> leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle fascia lata and a gelatin resorcin formalin glue cardial <EOS>
<SOS> in order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach <EOS>
<SOS> due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries <EOS>
<SOS> temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy <EOS>
<SOS> blindness causes human suffering and high social costs <EOS>
<SOS> virtually all blind people are registered with the social services <EOS>
<SOS> data from these institutions may help in long term planning for blindness prevention <EOS>
<SOS> the stage oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice <EOS>
<SOS> nowadays partial stem varicosis which is an earlier stage of the disease leads to operative treatment more frequently than <NUM> years ago thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> after surgery on a group of <NUM> patients we examined the stumps for patency the occurrence of varicose changes for their availability in the long term and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins <EOS>
<SOS> with a follow up period of up to <NUM> months postoperatively the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps 97 as well as a high sufficiency rate 94 with a mean graft length of <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions <EOS>
<SOS> this study supports the call for the stage oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis <EOS>
<SOS> background corneal hla dr antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage <EOS>
<SOS> this study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down regulation of the hla dr antigen or on a loss of the hla dr positive corneal langerhans cells lcs <EOS>
<SOS> the authors present a rare case of solitary non hodgkin lymphoma nhl in the skull of an 11 year old girl <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report <EOS>
<SOS> the morphological features of intra and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging <EOS>
<SOS> although rare nhl should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children <EOS>
<SOS> neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as parkinson disease and alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age <EOS>
<SOS> despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain <EOS>
<SOS> the neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies resulting in the development of new disease specific antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made <EOS>
<SOS> to obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies studies with clinically and neuropathologically well documented cases are needed <EOS>
<SOS> the project brain net has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a german brain and tissue bank for diseases of the central nervous system <EOS>
<SOS> the project is funded by the federal ministry of education and research <EOS>
<SOS> fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child is life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally <EOS>
<SOS> such surgery is a clinical reality now <EOS>
<SOS> indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities especially in the upper respiratory tract <EOS>
<SOS> these include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract <EOS>
<SOS> the relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance <EOS>
<SOS> in part of the procedures only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions even in cases with non lethal conditions <EOS>
<SOS> more diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications <EOS>
<SOS> one example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate which until now has only been performed in animal experiments <EOS>
<SOS> the particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> this offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth impeding scars <EOS>
<SOS> the particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 57 year old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate <EOS>
<SOS> for polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with primary malignant bone tumors 4 ewing <NUM> recurrent adamantinoma <NUM> maligne haemangioperizytoma the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation <EOS>
<SOS> during the follow up <NUM> 6 24 months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred <EOS>
<SOS> one recurrence occurred in the host bed in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection <EOS>
<SOS> the other cases showed good functional and radiological results <EOS>
<SOS> these clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo and radiotherapy sensitive bone tumors <EOS>
<SOS> effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial <EOS>
<SOS> numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> in patients undergoing vascular surgery epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability <EOS>
<SOS> these patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re operation <EOS>
<SOS> however regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> one reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care <EOS>
<SOS> a multimodal therapeutic approach which consists of preoperativ patient information sufficient analgesia early mobilisation and enteral feeding may solve this discrepancy <EOS>
<SOS> therefore prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome <EOS>
<SOS> although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after alzheimer is desease vascular dementia vd has remained so far an ill defined term <EOS>
<SOS> the main problems in the definition of vd arise from finding criteria for both terms vascular and dementia <EOS>
<SOS> the detailed criteria for the diagnosis of vd proposed by several groups or institutions addtc dsm iv icd 10 ninds arien are critically reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic value of some clinical findings especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in ct leuko araiosis are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the available studies suggest a differentiation of vd into some subtypes listed according to frequency subcortical vd vd with acute onset multiinfarct dementia mixed types and specific forms <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and therefore no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies <EOS>
<SOS> the aetiology of varicosis is still unclear <EOS>
<SOS> investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins <EOS>
<SOS> the rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the normal vein below this competent valve <EOS>
<SOS> the matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented explained the rigidity of varices <EOS>
<SOS> these results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall <EOS>
<SOS> an investigation of <NUM> knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments mfl humphry and wrisberg <EOS>
<SOS> of the knees examined 96 showed one or more ligaments the incidence was independent of gender or age <EOS>
<SOS> the osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of mfl <EOS>
<SOS> the ventral notch width index nwi after souryal was <NUM> in females and <NUM> in males <EOS>
<SOS> a dorsal notch width index dnwi which has not been described so far was <NUM> in females and <NUM> in males <EOS>
<SOS> the ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius wrisberg showed distinct morphological variations <EOS>
<SOS> this resulted in a classification of type i ii <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the study underline the importance of the mfl for knee joint function including stabilization proprioception and meniscal positioning <EOS>
<SOS> eleven patients with high grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar lined oesophagus and <NUM> patients with a squamous carcinoma ut1 underwent photodynamic therapy pdt and argon plasma coagulation apc <EOS>
<SOS> for pdt 5 aminolevulinic acid 5 ala was given orally 60 mg kg and treated endoscopically with a light dose of <NUM> j cm2 100 mw cm2 at <NUM> nm 4 6 h later <EOS>
<SOS> a second pdt was performed under the same conditions 2 3 weeks later <EOS>
<SOS> patients who received apc were treated <NUM> times on average to reach radical barrett mucosa eradication <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production <EOS>
<SOS> no complications occurred in either group <EOS>
<SOS> follow up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3 42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar lined oesophagus in all <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence <NUM> and <NUM> months later <EOS>
<SOS> pdt with 5 ala induced endogenous porphyrins as well as apc combined with omeprazole protection can eradicate superficial high grade dysplastic mucosa in barrett is oesophagus <EOS>
<SOS> however we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children <EOS>
<SOS> the rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing resulting in a decreased need for sedation <EOS>
<SOS> in addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend ct investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading <EOS>
<SOS> radiation dose reduction of 70 is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information <EOS>
<SOS> spiral low dose ct in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases mediastinal masses and central airway malformations <EOS>
<SOS> whether abdominal helical ct can be replaced by mri has to be decided in each individual case <EOS>
<SOS> when an exact protocol is used sufficient contrast material given scan delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method <EOS>
<SOS> invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen <EOS>
<SOS> resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical preventive or therapeutical indication on skin mucous membrane wounds in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp <EOS>
<SOS> opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented <EOS>
<SOS> with the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> at present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents <EOS>
<SOS> thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> hydatid disease still frequent in endemic areas is usually localized in the liver <EOS>
<SOS> despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay <EOS>
<SOS> based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily <EOS>
<SOS> background central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions <EOS>
<SOS> dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur <EOS>
<SOS> low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size density and physical as well as chemical properties <EOS>
<SOS> regarding size and density ldl can be divided into two main profiles ldl pattern a with elevated concentration of large buoyant ldl particles and ldl pattern b with increased concentration of small dense ldl particles <EOS>
<SOS> the latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of hdl and particularly hdl2 cholesterol <EOS>
<SOS> the ldl profile of increased concentration of small dense ldl particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events <EOS>
<SOS> the ldl profile is partly genetically determined but can be improved by non pharmacological exercise diet and pharmacological intervention <EOS>
<SOS> it remains to be confirmed whether the ldl subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides hdl2 cholesterol and triglycerides but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk <EOS>
<SOS> traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> in the hand which is perfused by two arteries this symptom could be missed <EOS>
<SOS> the hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris <EOS>
<SOS> dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late <EOS>
<SOS> a specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> there is no proven therapeutic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> however the administration is associated with side effects including respiratory depression somnolence and pruritus <EOS>
<SOS> a rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine hydromorphone alfentanil fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini review <EOS>
<SOS> thus the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages <EOS>
<SOS> notwithstanding epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route <EOS>
<SOS> in future reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine <MOB> may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone <EOS>
<SOS> the same holds true for <NUM> 2 adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants <EOS>
<SOS> however multicenter dose ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome <EOS>
<SOS> moreover we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method <EOS>
<SOS> progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of t4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation <EOS>
<SOS> by using ethibloc for embolization palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful <EOS>
<SOS> although local control of the tumor disease including complete tumor ablation is achieved by embolization the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> this short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor <EOS>

<SOS> content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the clinic for maxillofacial surgery at the charité <EOS>
<SOS> robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper firstly the state of the art is described <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail <EOS>
<SOS> the paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery <EOS>
<SOS> giant cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given and may potentially metastasize <EOS>
<SOS> by virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta articular localization giant cell bone tumors require specific surgical management <EOS>
<SOS> thus an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> these combined treatment modalities assure a high quality procedure defined as the actual way medical care is delivered by promoting the quality of the outcome defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient is state of health <EOS>
<SOS> we report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome <NUM> and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes <NUM> and <NUM> in the parents and other relatives <EOS>
<SOS> pedigree analysis reveals abortions frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths <EOS>
<SOS> our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms prominent forehead hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels hypertelorism cleft soft palate low set dysmorphic ears psychomotor retardation and micrognathie <EOS>
<SOS> renal cell carcinomas rcc are endowed with impressive metastatic potential <EOS>
<SOS> patients with rcc who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort <EOS>
<SOS> due to the different long term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic rcc lesions a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible <EOS>
<SOS> several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases <EOS>
<SOS> most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of rcc metastases surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> therefore an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients <EOS>

<SOS> the hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis ra as a t cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of t cells <EOS>
<SOS> the development of monoclonal antibodies against the t cell surface molecule cd4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of ra <EOS>
<SOS> however after encouraging results in early open studies double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti cd4 therapy in ra <EOS>
<SOS> there are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach <EOS>
<SOS> besides the fact that the t cell hypothesis of ra has <NUM> repeatedly been challenged pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the final evaluation of anti cd4 therapy <NUM> in ra will be possible only after <NUM> the testing of newly developed <NUM> non depleting anti cd4 anti bodies <EOS>

<SOS> one of these systems is the poly mesam unit map germany <EOS>
<SOS> guanine nucleotide binding proteins g proteins function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors <EOS>
<SOS> a large number of g protein linked receptors funnel extra cellular signals as diverse as hormones growth factors neurotransmitters and primary sensory stimuli through a set of g proteins to a small number of second messenger systems <EOS>
<SOS> the g proteins act as molecular switches with an on and off state governed by a gtpase cycle <EOS>
<SOS> by virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic gtpase activity the subunit of the g protein g plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding g protein <EOS>
<SOS> mutations of g may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations <EOS>
<SOS> given the variety of functions subserved by g protein coupled signal transduction it is not surprising that abnormalities in g protein coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness hormone resistance precocious puberty and neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> for a given defect in a g protein coupled pathway the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component <EOS>
<SOS> defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component particularly in germline mutations e g albright is hereditary osteodystrophy whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal e g mccune albright syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> mivacurium is a short acting nondepolarising muscle relaxant of the benzylisoquinoline type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> times the ed95 0 2 mg kg tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2 3 min following injection <EOS>
<SOS> the ensuing dur 25 i e time from injection to 25 recovery of control twitch tension is three times as long as with succinylcholine <EOS>
<SOS> the principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3 4 times the ed95 <EOS>

<SOS> the operability of a liver tumour depends on its three dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver sub segments <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to establish a computer based three dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver <EOS>
<SOS> methods using data from routine helical ct scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically <EOS>
<SOS> a dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an intelligent border finder <EOS>
<SOS> visualisation is performed by the heidelberg raytracer <EOS>
<SOS> the vascular trees are visualised as 3d graphs <EOS>
<SOS> pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically <EOS>
<SOS> security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal <EOS>
<SOS> results the 3d anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception <EOS>
<SOS> dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees <EOS>
<SOS> the system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour security margin and dependent liver parenchyma <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion three dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology <EOS>
<SOS> virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols which can be quantified and modified interactively <EOS>
<SOS> this will make operation planning more objective patient selection may be improved and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested <EOS>
<SOS> thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching surgical training and planning <EOS>

<SOS> methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing <EOS>
<SOS> p wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting <EOS>
<SOS> however correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p wave analysis with the high resolution ecg <EOS>
<SOS> signal averaging triggered to the p wave is significantly superior to qrs triggering <EOS>
<SOS> bidirectional filtering or fir filtering is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the data indicate significant differences in p wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> class i antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p wave duration but did not influence spectral parameters <EOS>
<SOS> treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p wave energy without altering p wave duration <EOS>
<SOS> after optimizing the methods p wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible <EOS>
<SOS> in the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit <EOS>
<SOS> these may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only <EOS>
<SOS> in literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of <NUM> 4 <EOS>
<SOS> extremely mobile long worm shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus related mortality rate which ranges from <NUM> 40 <EOS>

<SOS> reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia however are not known in detail <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species ros and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium or free radical mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia reperfusion <EOS>
<SOS> the mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition pt during the reperfusion period which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and a burst production of ros leading to cellular death <EOS>

<SOS> the presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis <EOS>
<SOS> purpose during the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life qol data regarding surgical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> methods the present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required nissen fundoplication of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the german gastrointestinal quality of life index giqli was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to <NUM> year <EOS>
<SOS> results preoperatively we found a low general giqli score mean <NUM> points which increased <NUM> weeks postoperatively <MOB> points <NUM> months <MOB> and <NUM> year mean <NUM> points significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population <MOB> points <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion it is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using qol <EOS>
<SOS> introduction serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign <EOS>
<SOS> methods we report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of <NUM> patients with these tumors <EOS>
<SOS> results between october <NUM> and december 1998 <NUM> patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection in <NUM> cases 11 women <NUM> man a serous cystadenoma 10 micrcocystic <NUM> oligomacrocystic was found <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> 50 patients had symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the mean tumor size was <NUM> <MOB> cm <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound ct and mrt usually could detect the mass but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable <EOS>
<SOS> all tumors were resected <NUM> whipple procedures <NUM> distal pancreatectomies and <NUM> segmental resection were performed <EOS>
<SOS> no patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected <EOS>
<SOS> we examined the prevalence of hiv associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of uv radiation in hiv infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of <NUM> patients seen between and <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> 41 patients were treated with uvb radiation and <NUM> patients with uva1 radiation while three patients received puva therapy <EOS>
<SOS> uv radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption atopic dermatitis and psoriasis <EOS>
<SOS> although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of uv radiation on the immunosystem of hiv positive patients no progression of the hiv infection due to phototherapy has been proven <EOS>
<SOS> the staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation <EOS>
<SOS> this applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions <EOS>
<SOS> it could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x ray tube <EOS>
<SOS> the effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about <NUM> msva <EOS>
<SOS> without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about <NUM> msva resulted <EOS>
<SOS> this corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about <NUM> msva in the federal republic of germany <EOS>
<SOS> from the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1 2 µsv per application for the physician averaged over all types of procedures <EOS>
<SOS> further it could be shown that the readings of the film badges usually worn by the staff underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two <EOS>
<SOS> this is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose <EOS>
<SOS> from the estimated annual effective dose a lifetime dose of <NUM> msv was estimated for a 40 year working career <EOS>
<SOS> the corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0 3 applying the icrp risk factor of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 10 2 sv 1 <EOS>
<SOS> considering the ncrp recommendations for a safe occupation working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures <EOS>
<SOS> however changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x ray tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care <EOS>
<SOS> one therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin pgi2 <EOS>
<SOS> this however is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reduced arterial oxygenation and systemic vasodilation <EOS>
<SOS> thus its clinical usefulness is limited <EOS>
<SOS> however the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide no or nebulized pgi2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange without any systemic vasodilation <EOS>
<SOS> it has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions <EOS>
<SOS> however the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects in the case of no toxic side effects are predominant methb nox whereas in the case of pgi2 technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore some patients do not respond to the treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation <EOS>
<SOS> the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of clinical success meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm cannot yet be definitively determined since no long term results are so far available <EOS>
<SOS> secondary leaks are observed in at least <NUM> of all patients making a further therapy necessary endorepair conversion embolization <EOS>
<SOS> further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal iliac attachment of the prostheses a better configuration and the development of long lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with <NUM> <NUM> g tuohy needles is reported at <NUM> 85 <EOS>
<SOS> a case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of <NUM> weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described <EOS>
<SOS> a 30 year old women had severe postspinal headache for <NUM> weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour <EOS>
<SOS> conservative therapy for <NUM> days and <NUM> days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3 week hospital stay and a subsequent 3 week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief <EOS>
<SOS> intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by cct <EOS>
<SOS> a pathologic eeg was not confirmed by cranial mrt <EOS>
<SOS> a lumbar epidural blood patch of <NUM> ml of autologous blood was performed at l3 4 <EOS>
<SOS> the patient stayed in bed for <NUM> h after <NUM> h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache <EOS>
<SOS> after a further <NUM> h of bedrest she had recovered <EOS>
<SOS> because of lumbar pain <NUM> days after the epidural blood patch a mrt was performed which showed the blood at l4 to s3 in the epidural space <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache the pain onset in the supine position <EOS>
<SOS> such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93 <EOS>
<SOS> volumes ranging from <NUM> to <NUM> ml are discussed for the autologous blood <EOS>
<SOS> we chose <NUM> ml of blood to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space <EOS>
<SOS> we were able to document the position of the blood patch as l4 to s3 on mr tomography the injection site was l3 4 <EOS>
<SOS> most patients are free of headache <NUM> h after epidural blood patch <EOS>
<SOS> our patient had to be confined to bed for another <NUM> h because of recurring headache <EOS>
<SOS> the blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage <EOS>
<SOS> probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of the large volume blood patch which diminished the leakage and conservative treatment which narrowed the transdural pressure difference was successful the 6 week postspinal headache was cured <EOS>
<SOS> prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch <EOS>
<SOS> the use of over <NUM> ml cannot be generally recommended although in this case most of the blood patch of <NUM> ml was localized caudally <EOS>
<SOS> careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> if there is no immediate relief conservative therapy with <NUM> <NUM> h of bedrest is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> if the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability hrv and on left ventricular function in <NUM> patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy idc <EOS>
<SOS> after a 3 to 4 week titration period carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily or the highest dose tolerated at least 25mg daily <EOS>
<SOS> maintenance treatment was then continued for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> digital 24 hour holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after <NUM> weeks of carvedilol therapy <EOS>
<SOS> hrv for the entire 24 hour period was computed in the time domain using the oxford medilog excel <NUM> analysis system <EOS>
<SOS> measures of hrv included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats rrm the standard deviation of all normal rr intervals sdnn the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal rr intervals rmssd and the proportion of adjacent normal rr intervals differing 50ms pnn50 <EOS>
<SOS> the histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features nuclear pleomorphism mitoses endothelial proliferation tumor necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> this grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist especially concerning the weighting of criteria scant moderate pronounced <EOS>
<SOS> an observer independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters <EOS>
<SOS> this grading procedure is recognized in the revised who classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas ste <EOS>
<SOS> anne mayo system sams <EOS>
<SOS> our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas <EOS>
<SOS> our recent investigations on glioma grading showed both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas that a two tiered grading scheme distinguishing only low grade and high grade cases was prognostically relevant <EOS>
<SOS> for all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in ct and mri seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the high malignancy grade <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery transmyocardial laser revascularization tmr often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity <EOS>
<SOS> one drawback of tmr is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a catheter based system has been developed which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity <EOS>
<SOS> several phase ii studies have proven that the beta interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta 1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published <EOS>
<SOS> in a multicenter double blind randomized placebo controlled study <NUM> patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale edss value between <NUM> and <NUM> were treated with either <NUM> mio <EOS>
<SOS> interferon beta 1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years <EOS>
<SOS> the primary study end point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the edss value for initial edss values between <NUM> and 5 5 or <NUM> point increase when the initial edss value was between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> after two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group p <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> this means that interferon beta 1b is the first recombinant beta interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> to test the effect of dorzolamide on accommodation or pupillary function <EOS>
<SOS> cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during early childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust disbelief and of being involved in a hysterical theatre performance so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out <EOS>
<SOS> in this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses 1 the incest phantasy is a narcissistic attempt 2 the incest phantasy is a symbolic representation 3 in the sense of a symbolic wish fullfillment included in the parent child interaction <EOS>
<SOS> after this an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future <EOS>
<SOS> hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections surveillance as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies § <NUM> abs <EOS>

<SOS> the nosocomial infections to be recorded i e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections <EOS>
<SOS> important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance <EOS>
<SOS> most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics <EOS>

<SOS> nasopharyngeal carcinomas npc belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world e g south east asia while they occur infrequently in western <NUM> europe <EOS>
<SOS> the association of npcs with epstein barr virus ebv a transforming human herpes virus is well established <EOS>
<SOS> the current who classification recognises two major npc histotypes non keratinising npc and squamous cell npc <EOS>
<SOS> ebv is invariably present in non keratinising npcs and the viral oncoprotein lmp 1 latent membrane protein 1 is expressed in some cases <EOS>
<SOS> the tumour cells of non keratinising npcs show phenotypic features which are inducible by lmp 1 in <NUM> vitro <EOS>
<SOS> these may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ <EOS>
<SOS> thus the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of <NUM> non keratinising npcs <EOS>
<SOS> by contrast the association of squamous cell npcs with ebv <NUM> displays a geographical variability <EOS>
<SOS> it appears therefore that squamous cell npcs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non keratinising npcs <EOS>
<SOS> to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in <NUM> patients with low grade glioma <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1996 <NUM> patients with astrocytoma <NUM> with oligodendroglioma and <NUM> with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of <NUM> gy range <NUM> to <NUM> gy <EOS>
<SOS> sixty seven patients were treated immediately following surgery <NUM> patients with tumor progression <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of various factors including histology gender age seizures duration of symptoms <NUM> weeks vs <NUM> weeks ct pattern enhancement vs no enhancement type of surgery total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse free survival and overall survival was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the median overall survival time was <NUM> month the 5 and 10 year survival rates were 54 and 31 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the median time to progression was <NUM> months while the 5 and 10 year progression free survival rates were 45 and 24 <EOS>
<SOS> univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose p 0 01 duration of symptoms p 0 05 the presence of seizures p 0 04 and the ct pattern following intravenous contrast p 0 005 as significant prognostic factors for overall survival <EOS>
<SOS> progression free survival rates were influenced by the total dose p 0 04 the duration of symptoms p 0 01 and ct pattern p 0 006 <EOS>
<SOS> on multivariate analysis only the ct pattern enhancement vs no enhancement remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression free survival and overall survival <EOS>
<SOS> a minimum total dose of <NUM> gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low grade glioma <EOS>
<SOS> tumors with ct enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we report three patients with severe guillain barré syndrome gbs <EOS>
<SOS> on clinical examination no sensory deficit was elicited <EOS>
<SOS> electromyography emg and motor nerve conduction velocity ncv studies were indicative of an axonal lesion <EOS>
<SOS> in two patients we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional emg activity <EOS>
<SOS> sensory ncv and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal <EOS>
<SOS> sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers some in the form of primary demyelination <EOS>
<SOS> therefore these cases must bei classified as combined motor sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings <EOS>
<SOS> although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred causing tetraparalysis this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to positive reports in literature immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases <EOS>
<SOS> continuous spinal anaesthesia csa is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single shot spinal ss combined spinal epidural and epidural anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> do hepatitis c virus hcv infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer <EOS>
<SOS> epidemiological data on hcv transmission <NUM> in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding hcv positive individuals from working as food handlers in general <EOS>
<SOS> such restrictions seem to be justified only if hcv infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> recently good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes <EOS>
<SOS> only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex <EOS>
<SOS> to demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study <EOS>
<SOS> dementia screening in clinical routine requires short sensitive and specific tools <EOS>
<SOS> a number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose <EOS>
<SOS> the present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy <EOS>
<SOS> a phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology <EOS>
<SOS> the most important reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made <EOS>
<SOS> additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour coded duplex sonography <EOS>
<SOS> a thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with severe post thrombotic disease a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography and if possible dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination <EOS>
<SOS> there is currently no generally valid schematization of the post thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion <EOS>
<SOS> when evaluating patients we largely follow our own new classification which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics dnpu has so far been rather ineffective recent reports of successful management of dnpu by short term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions rvp by south american angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic dnpu <EOS>
<SOS> hence in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in <NUM> we have treated <NUM> male diabetics suffering from dnpu with the same daily doses of netilmycin administered either in systemic venous infusions svi n 21 three times day or in rvp n 24 once day <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> consecutive days of treatment ulcers had closed in <NUM> of the <NUM> patients treated with rvp as against <NUM> of the <NUM> treated with svi <EOS>
<SOS> diminution of the ulcer area by 30 including full debridement was achieved in 10 24 of the rvp cases svi 4 21 <EOS>
<SOS> during <NUM> months of follow up amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only <NUM> patient in the rvp group but in <NUM> in the svi group <EOS>
<SOS> partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after rvp <EOS>
<SOS> our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the rvp procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by svi for the treatment of dnpu <EOS>
<SOS> rvp can be recommended in dnpu particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections <EOS>
<SOS> there is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research that is to say ultimately what is medically possible and human dignity and the protection of life or in other words what can be justified in ethical or legal terms so clearly as reproduction medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide the many questions raised by assisted fertilization and especially by anonymous sperm donation and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts <EOS>
<SOS> in a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus <EOS>
<SOS> against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important and the notes in this paper which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue are intended to stimulate such discussion <EOS>
<SOS> in mr imaging similar to computed tomography diagnosis of metastatic lymph node disease is based on lymph node sizes and thereby it is non specific <EOS>
<SOS> superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for mr lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic interstitial and in case of very small particles after intravenous injection <EOS>
<SOS> no accumulation occures in lymph node metastases <EOS>
<SOS> lymph node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques <EOS>
<SOS> it has been shown experimentally that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes <EOS>
<SOS> however mr lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph node groups <EOS>
<SOS> the experimental results with endolymphatic interstitial and intravenous mr lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles <EOS>
<SOS> in 1993 we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty tap of the thoraco abdominal aortic segment ii iv in chronic expanding type b aortic dissection cead to achieve <NUM> primary goals <NUM> reduction of renal visceral and spinal cord ischemic time <NUM> safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications i e paraplegia kidney failure and intestinal infarction <EOS>

<SOS> tap consists of <NUM> left posterolateral aortotomy from th <NUM> l 2 <NUM> excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane s <NUM> aortic closure to a diameter of <NUM> cm to reduce wall tension <EOS>
<SOS> all <NUM> patients survived without any major complications particularly no paraplegia <EOS>
<SOS> mean cross clamping was <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months <NUM> patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line <EOS>
<SOS> after mean follow up of <NUM> years ct angiography revealed a stable tap segment mean aortic <NUM> cm in <NUM> patients and one re expanded tap segment from <NUM> cm after <NUM> months up to <NUM> cm without signs of re dissection <EOS>
<SOS> our 4 year results 1 corroborate the johns hopkins data <EOS>
<SOS> although one re expanded tap segment is disquieting we found the short term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients <EOS>
<SOS> all optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands that can have different three dimensional positions <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane polarized light <EOS>
<SOS> when the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions they are called racemic mixture a mixture that does not rotate polarized light since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other <EOS>
<SOS> although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity <EOS>
<SOS> the human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties when used as pure optical isomers <EOS>
<SOS> till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers which are mainly used as racemic mixture 1 1 mixture <EOS>
<SOS> for financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects <EOS>
<SOS> among the modern anaesthetics ketamine isoflurane bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon <EOS>
<SOS> for most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects <EOS>
<SOS> for volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far <EOS>
<SOS> the high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease <EOS>
<SOS> our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease <EOS>

<SOS> controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ent clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance n 52 <EOS>
<SOS> the application of a tryptophan free amino acid mixture tryptophan depletion test induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan <EOS>
<SOS> consequently the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased <EOS>
<SOS> this method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion <EOS>
<SOS> in depressed patients during an antidepressant or light therapy induced stable remission a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion <EOS>
<SOS> healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion <EOS>
<SOS> these findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants <EOS>
<SOS> since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non depressed patients <EOS>
<SOS> several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia fm although they are often associated with it <EOS>
<SOS> they may mimick fm by 1 the occurance of wide spread pain 2 the chronicity of complaints 3 the preponderance of females in some of these and 4 the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests <EOS>
<SOS> pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function dysfunctional syndromes masi ref <EOS>
<SOS> recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper and hypomobility syndromes treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis also called cellulitis which may be mixed up with fm due to its preferential occurance in peri or postmenopausal women <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding fm and all studies dealing with fm <EOS>

<SOS> despite increasing operator experience and improved technology abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty <EOS>
<SOS> intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the gp iib iia receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem <EOS>
<SOS> about 50 of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction necessity of cabg or death occurring in up to 10 of acute occlusions <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure <EOS>
<SOS> ptca in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build up region is necessary for high energy photon beams <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build up and skin dose for 6 and 18 mv photons are analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> measurements were made with 6 and 18 mv photons using a ptw parallel plate ionization chamber b<MOB> and a rdm 1f electrometer <EOS>
<SOS> build up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a <NUM> x <NUM> x <NUM> cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed ssd of <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> the entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a <NUM> ° wedge <EOS>
<SOS> exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top <NUM> cm thick piece of wood and the <NUM> cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments <EOS>
<SOS> it was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators <EOS>
<SOS> for both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size <EOS>
<SOS> it was also noticed that the dose in the build up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose <EOS>
<SOS> the data show that the tray pertubation factor tpf at surface decreases steadily with tray surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes <EOS>
<SOS> it was noted that the tpf was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray surface distances for both energies <EOS>
<SOS> at tray surface distances above <NUM> cm the tpf almost remained close to unity for 6 mv photons for all field sizes whereas the continuous decrease in tpf could be noted for 18 mv photon beams even after the tpf rewached unity <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials <EOS>
<SOS> the use of wedge filters absorbs low energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence the relative surface dose rsd is always less than unity <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet diet i adapted to nutritional habits in germany <EOS>
<SOS> data were compared to a low fat diet diet ii according to the american heart association <EOS>
<SOS> the study was performed in <NUM> patients with coronary heart disease 30 males and <NUM> females age 45 83 yrs stratified to the <NUM> dietary treatments <EOS>
<SOS> daily fat intake was 38g 24 of energy intake of 6 5mj d in diet i and 60g 31 of 7 3mj d in diet ii p0 01 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> when compared with dietii in dieti the intake of cholesterol saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids vit <EOS>
<SOS> b12 were all reduced p0 01 whereas the uptake of vit <EOS>
<SOS> c was increased p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> the intake of folic acid was low in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> both diets resulted in a decrease in bmi systolic and diastolic blood pressure plasma cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels <EOS>
<SOS> concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dieti but hdl cholesterol levels remained unchanged <EOS>
<SOS> reduction of bmi and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline bmi and cholesterol concentrations respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the cholesterol lowering effect of diet i is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account the nutritional habits in germany very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value <EOS>
<SOS> both diets are effective in lowering body weight plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting hdl cholesterol <EOS>
<SOS> these effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients <EOS>
<SOS> besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy arvd exists yet <EOS>
<SOS> criteria for the clinical diagnosis of avrd were complied in <NUM> by members of the isfc work group and the european association for cardiology <EOS>

<SOS> with the successive examination of a collective of <NUM> patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of arvd at the jean rostand hospital in ivry sur seien france the value of the complied criteria were checked <EOS>
<SOS> global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in <NUM> patients 83 using angiography or electrocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> four patients 16 exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined <EOS>
<SOS> t inversion in the right precordial leads were present in <NUM> patients 71 <EOS>
<SOS> a localized qrs widening of more than 110ms in v1 to v3 in <NUM> patients 33 and an epsilon wave in <NUM> patients 25 were observed as major criteria <EOS>

<SOS> left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia which was classified as a minor criterion was observed in <NUM> patients 96 only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> a previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in <NUM> of <NUM> patients 15 <EOS>
<SOS> the complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of avrd led in all <NUM> cases to the diagnosis of the disease whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard <EOS>
<SOS> without inclusion of histological data the clinical diagnosis was determined in only <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible <EOS>
<SOS> subungual keratoacanthomas ska differ in clinical presentation biological behaviour and the therapy needed from keratoacanthomas in other localizations <EOS>
<SOS> against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm <EOS>
<SOS> patients present with a rapidly growing painful subungual mass which causes destruction of the underlying bone and usually does not regress spontaneously <EOS>
<SOS> histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different <EOS>
<SOS> ska is treated by local excision and curettage <EOS>
<SOS> erosions of the underlying distal phalanx usually heal spontaneously <EOS>
<SOS> however persistent recurrences after subtotal excision often necessitate amputation of the distal phalanx <EOS>
<SOS> leukotrienes and prostaglandines are important mediators of inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> while prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by nsaids therapeutical approaches to the 5 lipoxygenase pathway are rare <EOS>
<SOS> resinous extracts of boswellia serrata h15 indish incense known from traditional ayurvedic medicine decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro <EOS>

<SOS> methods outpatients with active ra have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial <EOS>
<SOS> patients received <NUM> tablets of active drug 3600 mg or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy <EOS>
<SOS> doses of nsaids could be adjusted on demand <EOS>
<SOS> efficacy parameters ritchies index for swelling and pain esr crp pain on vas and nsaid dose were documented at baseline and <NUM> and <NUM> weeks after initiation <EOS>
<SOS> mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation <EOS>

<SOS> a 61 year old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light exposed areas after taking st john is wort extract for three years <EOS>
<SOS> routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative <EOS>
<SOS> using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with st john is wort we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the med uvb which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication <EOS>
<SOS> due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> high flow phases for wash in or wash out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short the difference between the volatile is concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the monitoring required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards <EOS>
<SOS> as compound a may accumulate in the breathing system sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than <NUM> l min until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved <EOS>
<SOS> low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash out of trace gases <EOS>
<SOS> thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent <EOS>
<SOS> the gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients <EOS>
<SOS> only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency <EOS>
<SOS> cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> the typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk <EOS>
<SOS> immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or ptca can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion <EOS>
<SOS> several non randomized studies suggest that ptca is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> however aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock <EOS>
<SOS> early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum <EOS>

<SOS> object of this review is to present the physiological principles diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> despite intense research activities in this area many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear <EOS>
<SOS> for example the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven yet <EOS>
<SOS> beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> until now it was not shown whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients <EOS>
<SOS> it is also unknown which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients <EOS>
<SOS> in future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers <EOS>
<SOS> a new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon <EOS>
<SOS> it was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals healthy volunteers and patients <EOS>
<SOS> with the approval of the animal ethics committee a total of <NUM> anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments <EOS>
<SOS> balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in <NUM> pigs <EOS>
<SOS> six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls <EOS>
<SOS> vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro oesophageal lower oesophageal sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope <EOS>
<SOS> with local ethics committee approval and informed written consent 1 repeated vomiting was provoked in <NUM> awake healthy adult volunteers 10 females <NUM> males <NUM> <NUM> years with a fluid filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia while intragastric pressure was monitored and 2 <NUM> patients 21 <NUM> years with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon <EOS>
<SOS> pigs n 10 with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of <NUM> manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation while <NUM> of the <NUM> provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs n 6 with an unblocked cardia <EOS>
<SOS> among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia n 16 reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting <EOS>
<SOS> after termination of the occlusion of the cardia reflux was able to be induced by <NUM> of the <NUM> volunteers <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems <EOS>
<SOS> the average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was <NUM> <NUM> s conclusions <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded from the present results with further clinical studies pending that the gastric balloon probe permits low risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase <EOS>
<SOS> the article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the basic assumption is pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals <EOS>
<SOS> patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs <EOS>
<SOS> in psychotherapy the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist <EOS>
<SOS> in this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences <EOS>
<SOS> the theory is supported by numerous empirical studies <EOS>
<SOS> treatment with nootropic drugs of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary <EOS>
<SOS> to define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs effects and side effects economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied <EOS>
<SOS> a summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects <EOS>
<SOS> there are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects <EOS>
<SOS> delayed admission to care units leads to a positi ve cost effect of nootropics <EOS>
<SOS> thus also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics <EOS>
<SOS> better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment <EOS>
<SOS> a proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data <EOS>

<SOS> we evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure ptio2 and global cerebral blood flow cbf during cardiopulmonary bypass cpb with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest dhca in ten anesthetized new zealand white rabbits body weight <NUM> <NUM> kg <EOS>
<SOS> cbf hydrogen desaturation clearance technique and ptio2 licox microsensor right frontoparietal cortex were determined <EOS>
<SOS> after median sternotomy the animals were placed on cpb standard roller pump nonpulsatile stat acid base management perfusion flow of <MOB> ml kg min right atrial and aortic cannulation for induction of dhca by cooling to <NUM> °c rectal temperature 1 °c per minute <EOS>
<SOS> rewarming period was started after <NUM> minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from cpb without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support <EOS>
<SOS> under baseline conditions ptio2 was <NUM> <NUM> mmhg and did not change significantly before dhca <EOS>
<SOS> during dhca the ptio2 decreased within <NUM> minutes to <NUM> <NUM> mmhg after <NUM> minutes to <NUM> <NUM> mmhg and after <NUM> minutes to zero <EOS>
<SOS> neither the ptio2 nor cbf recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion ptio2 25 <NUM> mmhg vs baseline <NUM> <NUM> mmhg p0 05 and cbf 43 <NUM> vs baseline <NUM> <NUM> ml 100 g min p0 05 were significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> arterial and jugular venous lactate levels increased after rewarming p0 05 and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> these data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptio2 brain tissue oxygenation and cbf oxygen supply during and after rewarming from dhca <EOS>
<SOS> the induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular mitochondrial level <EOS>
<SOS> thus a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during cpb resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution mitochondrial dysfunction and or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption compensation of an oxygen debt is a possible explanation <EOS>

<SOS> experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man <EOS>
<SOS> ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable <EOS>
<SOS> because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high density optical and electrical activation mapping animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed <EOS>

<SOS> the authors report a rare recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one lung ventilation olv via a double lumen tube dlt and left sided thoracotomy an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung <EOS>
<SOS> this occurred in a 63 year old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross clamping release <EOS>
<SOS> the common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration <EOS>
<SOS> although the above presentation could be seen in this case the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice <EOS>
<SOS> first symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head down tilt and aortic declamping <EOS>
<SOS> second since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems complications resulting from the use of a dlt were primarily considered <EOS>
<SOS> in particular since breathing sounds were detectable initially malposition or torsion of the dlt had to be excluded by fibre optic bronchoscopy which involved a further delay <EOS>
<SOS> finally two observations led to the diagnosis of a right sided tension pneumothorax 1 bullae of the contralateral lung detected during thoracotomy 2 the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial sao2 and mixed venous oxygen saturation svo2 and the circulatory status but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration <EOS>
<SOS> chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air thereafter validated our hypothesis <EOS>
<SOS> the time course of oxygen desaturation during olv and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected the time course of haemodynamic deterioration however appeared quicker and had more impact than expected <EOS>
<SOS> assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax <EOS>
<SOS> yet during thoracotomy decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in olv obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed chest patients <EOS>
<SOS> in summary a tension pneumothorax during one lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare but disastrous complication during the use of a dlt which has not to our knowledge been reported previously <EOS>
<SOS> we recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during olv by the use of a dlt especially in patients with structural lung diseases <EOS>
<SOS> the intramedullary hip screw system classic nail and the dynamic hip screw dhs were evaluated in a prospective randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures <EOS>
<SOS> hundred and ten geriatric patients mean age <NUM> years were runningly included in the study 56 classic nail <NUM> dhs <EOS>
<SOS> no significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow up data <EOS>
<SOS> with the classic nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires <EOS>

<SOS> introduction the goal of this study was to compare contrast enhanced t1 weighted flash and turbo flash sequences with conventional spin echo sequences as a basis for planning high precision radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> methods a total of <NUM> consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood brain barrier were studied <EOS>
<SOS> t1 weighted flash turbo flash and conventional spin echo images were evaluated after controlled 30 s infusion of <NUM> mmol kg body weight of gd dtpa <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal and contrast to noise ratios the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts and the measurement of tumor size <EOS>
<SOS> results the signal and contrast to noise ratios were significantly p <MOB> lower for flash and turbo flash than for conventional spin echo sequences <EOS>
<SOS> however visual inspection of the contrast enhancing tumors revealed in <NUM> and <NUM> of <NUM> lesions on flash and tu rbo flash images respectively good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7 8 <EOS>
<SOS> flash and turbo flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts conventional spin echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa <EOS>
<SOS> tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion at present conventional spin echo images are superior to fast flash and ultrafast turbo flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high precision radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> however fast flash and turbo flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device <EOS>
<SOS> despite some limitations turbo flash sequences enable fast dynamic mr imaging combined with an acceptable morphology which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high precision radiotherapy <EOS>

<SOS> it is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> when protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis after gut injury after surgical trauma sepsis rapid growth pregnancy or newborn infants etc <EOS>
<SOS> some tissues with a rapid turnover gut and immune system may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet <EOS>
<SOS> therefore nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients <EOS>
<SOS> this article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine maturation and recovery and gut microflora lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system <EOS>
<SOS> human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines <EOS>
<SOS> moreover pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue rna as compared to purine ones <EOS>
<SOS> additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas <EOS>
<SOS> this includes 1 to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue rna is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2 to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides <EOS>
<SOS> parkinson is disease pd causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course the duration of the disease the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> in germany more than dm <NUM> million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of pd by assessing direct medical costs <EOS>
<SOS> forty patients suffering from idiopathic pd were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources <NUM> months prior to the study <EOS>
<SOS> the total annual costs reported were dm 14 500 consisting of dm <NUM> for drug therapy and dm <NUM> for other medical services including hospital inpatient care dm 5600 outpatient care dm 700 medical sundries dm 1100 and physiotherapy dm 600 <EOS>
<SOS> the costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease hoehn and yahr stage hy and the occurrence of motor fluctuations dyskinesias we found that both drug therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from hyi to hyiv <EOS>
<SOS> the rarely employed s c therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in hyv <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of fluctuations dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two <EOS>
<SOS> indirect burden due to increased days off of work unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in parkinson is disease <EOS>
<SOS> this study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from pd but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system <EOS>
<SOS> the cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause <EOS>
<SOS> after having been frozen and subsequently thawed the tissue can ideally be transplanted to its original site where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation <EOS>
<SOS> heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in scid mice <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the use of whole tissue the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation ivm are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> as in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes <EOS>
<SOS> although considerable progress has already been made in both directions these are still at the present time experimental processes that require further in depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue ivm of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction <EOS>
<SOS> the successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> ivm is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of pcos patients for instance increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by rescuing ivf cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes <EOS>
<SOS> background transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the german registry for hearing loss in children dzh processes nationwide data from audiological centers <EOS>
<SOS> coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control <EOS>
<SOS> to establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states <EOS>
<SOS> use of the dzh as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached <EOS>
<SOS> special issues concerning data collection transfer storage and deletion coding strategies to ensure anonymity checking for duplicate entries data separation and automated data analysis and data protection are explained <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> this interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> the social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness weariness by affluence ignorance and by misunderstanding <EOS>
<SOS> as a final result an unscientific era comes about on which karl jaspers commented in <NUM> that only this unscientific spirit had made national socialism possible <EOS>
<SOS> based on the good statistical results of german obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries it is shown that our patients demands for gentle obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics <EOS>
<SOS> if the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together safe and gentle obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother <EOS>
<SOS> objectives due to its unique pharmacokinetics the new esterase metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post anaesthesia recovery <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane <EOS>
<SOS> dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer <EOS>
<SOS> methods patients asa status i ii scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial <EOS>
<SOS> without premedication in the morning anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups remifentanil bolus 1 µg kg start of remifentanil infusion 0 5 µg kg min followed immediately by propofol ca <EOS>
<SOS> for maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil 0 25 µg kg min was combined with either a propofol infusion of <NUM> mg kg min or <NUM> mac isoflurane 0 6 vol in o2 air <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> results a total of <NUM> patients were studied at random in two groups of <NUM> each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique tables <NUM> and 2 <EOS>
<SOS> in both groups emergence was very rapid <EOS>
<SOS> recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil isoflurane than for remifentanil propofol table 3 spontaneous ventilation <NUM> vs <NUM> min p0 05 extubation <NUM> vs <NUM> min p0 02 post anaesthesia recovery score 9 of <NUM> points <NUM> vs <NUM> min p0 01 and arrival at pacu <NUM> vs <NUM> min p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40 of all patients 9 cases following isoflurane <NUM> following propofol <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions using the manufacturer is recommended dosages emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with <NUM> mac isoflurane than with <NUM> mg kg min propofol <EOS>
<SOS> these results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co anaesthetics especially the applied dosages and to different interactions with remifentanil <EOS>
<SOS> present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction especially for propofol is possible <EOS>
<SOS> for both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state on off phenomenon which might contribute to post anaesthesia safety <EOS>
<SOS> exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma with uva possibly playing an important role <EOS>
<SOS> hereditary factors are also relevant <EOS>
<SOS> in the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods <EOS>
<SOS> in xeroderma pigmentosum the dna repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> frequent and non random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells <EOS>
<SOS> these might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes <EOS>
<SOS> especially the short arm of chromosome <NUM> is thought to contain one of these genes <EOS>
<SOS> this hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas <EOS>
<SOS> changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known <EOS>
<SOS> neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood is epilepsy <EOS>
<SOS> up to now it is not totally understood if focal eeg pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere is functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres <EOS>
<SOS> in a sample of <NUM> pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing <EOS>
<SOS> as a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing more sequential than simultaneous has been found <EOS>
<SOS> there was no correlation with the localization of an eeg focus nor with the hand preference <EOS>
<SOS> according to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment <EOS>
<SOS> our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy <EOS>
<SOS> so far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in icd therapy do not exist <EOS>
<SOS> the shock energy tested during long term follow up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold dft <EOS>
<SOS> a total number of <NUM> consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of icd patients were evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> all patients received a non thoracotomy lead system cpi endotak 0070 0090 and a biphasic cardioverter defibrillator with the ability to store episodes cardiac pacemakers inc ventac tm prx ii prx ii <EOS>
<SOS> the intraoperative defibrillation threshold dft was evaluated in a step down protocol 15 10 8 <NUM> j and hat to be 15 j for inclusion into the study <EOS>
<SOS> the lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as dft augmented defibrillation threshold <EOS>
<SOS> the dft value was tested immediately after successful implantation at discharge and after a follow up period of one year <EOS>
<SOS> prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups <EOS>
<SOS> the energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice dft and in the control group at the maximum energy output 34 j <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in dft testings and in spontaneous episodes during long term follow up of the study group were compared to those in the control group <EOS>
<SOS> a dft value was found to be 15 j in <NUM> of <NUM> patients 94 <EOS>
<SOS> the dft in the study group was 9 6 3 2 in control group 10 1 35 j <EOS>
<SOS> the prohability of successful defibrillation at dft level after one year was 84 <EOS>
<SOS> the success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation vf was 99 5 in the study group 217 of <NUM> episodes and 99 in the control group 201 of <NUM> episodes <EOS>
<SOS> during follow up of 24 9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group 83 86 96 5 monomorphic ventricular tachycardias mvt and 38 40 95 vf episodes were converted successfully by the 2x dft shock <EOS>
<SOS> in the control group the first shock was successful in 151 156 96 8 spontaneous mvts and in 30 33 91 vf episodes <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease left ventricular function ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the dft itself <EOS>
<SOS> at a mean follow up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death 2 4 in the study group vs 3 8 in the control group <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion programming the first shock with the icd lead system used in this study at 2x dft is as efficient as a shock energy of <NUM> j in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of vt vf <EOS>
<SOS> thus the safety of icd therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x dft value <EOS>
<SOS> culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of controversy it is the physician is due to prove the correct preoperative information <EOS>
<SOS> to reduce these liability risks a computer based information system has been developed <EOS>
<SOS> with its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient <EOS>
<SOS> based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place <EOS>
<SOS> after the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information <EOS>
<SOS> the conception is use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached <EOS>
<SOS> in vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives <EOS>
<SOS> two test models are differentiated 1 separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and 2 peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants <EOS>
<SOS> considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds lavasept 0 1 may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds for drip suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application <NUM> h and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage <EOS>
<SOS> betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> for short term rinsing of deep wounds including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage <EOS>
<SOS> ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis <EOS>
<SOS> pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain <EOS>
<SOS> thus pain makes high demands on the health system <EOS>
<SOS> for the first time in the federal republic of germany the national health interview and examination survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain its intensity frequency duration and localisation <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the results enable to differentiate according to age gender and social classes <EOS>
<SOS> the sf 36 used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well being of the population <EOS>
<SOS> in this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated <EOS>

<SOS> of the <NUM> cases <NUM> were gunshot injuries and <NUM> were classified as suicide <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest <EOS>
<SOS> attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers <EOS>

<SOS> non traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> these fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> the outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs <EOS>
<SOS> the therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava <EOS>

<SOS> acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is rare but beset with a high mortality rate <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years however a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> high inspiratory oxygen concentrations large tidal volumes and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ards <EOS>
<SOS> this had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy <EOS>
<SOS> mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ards have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung prevent oxygen toxicity recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space <EOS>
<SOS> this new approach consists of various forms of pressure controlled mechanical ventilation with peep and permissive hypercapnia body position changes and inhalation of nitric oxide <EOS>
<SOS> should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option <EOS>
<SOS> none of these therapeutic procedures however has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial <EOS>
<SOS> the following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of ards <EOS>
<SOS> femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly <EOS>
<SOS> they can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws lag screws bipolar hemiprotheses or total hip replacement <EOS>
<SOS> the results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant <EOS>

<SOS> stool frequency after ileal pouch anal anastomosis ipaa is about 5 day after adaptation during the first year <EOS>
<SOS> it depends on stool volume and pouch capacity not on the design of the pouch <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum <EOS>
<SOS> 67 of patients are perfectly continent while <NUM> have to wear pads due to intermittent leakage <EOS>
<SOS> complete incontinence is reported in 0 4 of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> preservation of the anal transitional zone by the double stapling technique does not improve functional results when compared to endoanal mucosectomy or intersphincteric resection <EOS>
<SOS> impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch anal pressure gradient <EOS>
<SOS> despite altered reflex activity stool discrimination is preserved in most patients <EOS>

<SOS> we describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene gys2 gene <EOS>
<SOS> hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch <EOS>
<SOS> although most subacromial decompressions are performed arthroscopically rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini open procedure <EOS>

<SOS> procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity <EOS>
<SOS> normally procalcitonin is produced in the c cells of the thyroid gland <EOS>
<SOS> in healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable 0 1 ng ml <EOS>
<SOS> during severe generalized infections bacterial parasitic and fungal with systemic manifestations procalcitonin levels may rise up to <NUM> ng ml <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels <EOS>
<SOS> the exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study oncologic and functional results of <NUM> patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages c and d are reported <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid transcervical approach which was modified according to individual tumor growth <EOS>

<SOS> ecg triggered acquisition of <NUM> to <NUM> axial images 3 mm slice thickness in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3 dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart <EOS>
<SOS> overall acquisition times are approximately <NUM> to <NUM> seconds <EOS>
<SOS> while electron beam ct in general permits a complete cardiac investigation including morphology function and perfusion the method is most important application is non invasive imaging of the coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> without contrast enhancement coronary calcification by ebct currently constitutes the most sensitive non invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses <EOS>
<SOS> this method is especially well suited in the follow up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting <EOS>
<SOS> breathhold and movement artifacts superposition of coronary arteries and veins as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method is main problems <EOS>

<SOS> in both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination <EOS>
<SOS> in the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long standing arterial hypertension were known however it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral ct was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection <EOS>
<SOS> at this time 48 h after onset of symptoms the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal <EOS>
<SOS> in the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection <EOS>
<SOS> widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type b dissection <EOS>
<SOS> the serum test <NUM> h after onset of pain revealed elevated diagnostic serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10 25 of school aged children thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> despite that our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete <EOS>
<SOS> following oral surgery there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> it was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from <NUM> patients 19 to <NUM> years of age prior to oral surgery <EOS>
<SOS> flow rate ph standard bicarbonate total buffer bases peroxidase lysozyme thiocyanate secretory immunoglobulin a lactoferrin total protein tissue type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined <EOS>
<SOS> the salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of <NUM> randomly selected patients with normal wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva <EOS>
<SOS> in stimulated saliva decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found <EOS>
<SOS> not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator peroxidase plus secretory immunoglobulin a measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible <EOS>
<SOS> a discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups <EOS>
<SOS> nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function perfusion and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology <EOS>
<SOS> advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations <EOS>
<SOS> the improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making <EOS>
<SOS> information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required <EOS>
<SOS> nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease <EOS>
<SOS> the prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease <EOS>
<SOS> extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease specific molecular targeted cardiac imaging in the future <EOS>
<SOS> epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics <EOS>
<SOS> however despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia 21 <EOS>
<SOS> addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn 24 <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression 6 26 <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of <NUM> mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection <EOS>
<SOS> even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread loaf fashion subsequent to formalin fixation and serial cross sectioning of the coronary arteries with decalcification in addition if necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis the longitudinal circumferential and transmural extent of infarction its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood <EOS>
<SOS> cross sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing plaque hemorrhage parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery <EOS>
<SOS> transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short term territorial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> full thickness samples of the ventricular walls taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas enable identification of early myocardial damage <EOS>
<SOS> total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation <EOS>
<SOS> we reviewed the different principles with particular reference to long term clinical outcome and discuss the most popular systems available in germany <EOS>
<SOS> despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the gold standard until prospective long term data 15 years of cementless systems become available <EOS>
<SOS> to summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease crohn is disease ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis <EOS>
<SOS> procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin <EOS>
<SOS> it is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial parasitic or fungal infection <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non infectious systemic inflammatory states <EOS>
<SOS> because of these properties procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity <EOS>
<SOS> normally procalcitonin is produced in the c cells of the thyroid gland <EOS>
<SOS> the origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood <EOS>
<SOS> although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> more studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries <EOS>
<SOS> these are or are associated with phalangeal fractures <EOS>
<SOS> kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted kirschner wires of 1 0 1 25 <NUM> and <NUM> mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of <NUM> fresh cadaver hands <EOS>
<SOS> we found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing kirschner wire diameter <EOS>
<SOS> because of these findings kirschner wires of <NUM> or <NUM> mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures <EOS>
<SOS> fucosidosis a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of l fucosidase was diagnosed in two unrelated male german patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation dysostosis multiplex vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of <NUM> and <NUM> years respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases activity of l fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible <EOS>
<SOS> dna analysis revealed a nonsense mutation g401x in exon <NUM> of the fucosidase gene this leads to a premature stop codon and c terminal deletion of <NUM> amino acids from the protein <EOS>
<SOS> discussion on account of the mutation a unique pflmi restriction site is obliterated this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the g401x mutation <EOS>
<SOS> so far the mutation g401x has not been found in any other population <EOS>
<SOS> the main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia <EOS>
<SOS> both severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not <EOS>
<SOS> for the clinical routine the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low cpp low jugularvenous oxygen saturation sjo2 or low tissue po2 <EOS>
<SOS> to minimize misleading false negative sjo2 the ct approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional cbf <EOS>
<SOS> within the autoregulatory range decreasing cpp causes vasodilation and increasing cpp vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively <EOS>
<SOS> initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires cpp <NUM> mmhg <EOS>
<SOS> targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing cpp <EOS>
<SOS> in the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of cbf by means of cpp and cerebral vascular resistance <EOS>
<SOS> thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important <EOS>
<SOS> today orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end stage of various liver diseases and a 1 year survival rate of <NUM> and a 5 year survival rate of <NUM> in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys <EOS>
<SOS> the liver transplant programme of the inselspital in bern is small compared with international centres which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme <EOS>
<SOS> over a period of <NUM> months <NUM> liver transplantations were performed in <NUM> patients at the inselspital <EOS>
<SOS> the hospital mortality was <NUM> and the 2 5 year overall survival rate was <NUM> for elective cases without tumor <EOS>
<SOS> after a median follow up of <NUM> months <NUM> of all patients were re integrated in housework or full or part time in their profession and <NUM> were independent from the help of others <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards <EOS>
<SOS> accidental hypothermia ah can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below <NUM> <NUM> °c during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co morbid factors such as trauma submersion intoxication and underlying diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in trauma victims stratified according to the injury severity score the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival <EOS>
<SOS> in these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible <EOS>
<SOS> in the utrecht university hospital adult patients with ah are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions <EOS>
<SOS> patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over <NUM> mmhg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming cavr <EOS>
<SOS> arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass cpb <EOS>
<SOS> in a 3 year period <NUM> patients with ah were admitted to the emergency department <EOS>
<SOS> fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia <EOS>
<SOS> twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm cavr n 18 cpb n 2 and two patients were alternatively managed <EOS>
<SOS> mortality in the cavr group was <NUM> and total mortality reached <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> complications of cavr are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation <EOS>
<SOS> cavr permits a good access to the trauma patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries <EOS>
<SOS> the grading of long tubular bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non unions <EOS>
<SOS> hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non unions whereas non reacting non unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance <EOS>
<SOS> pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing which consists of osteoregeneration osteovascularization and stabilization <EOS>
<SOS> the causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost cortical substance and medullary space <EOS>
<SOS> this can occur from trauma but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone healing into account <EOS>
<SOS> surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture healing and fracture union <EOS>
<SOS> background clonidine an 2 receptor agonist has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics <EOS>
<SOS> differentiation of an elevated repeatedly determined platelet count 500x109 l includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera tive disorder cmpd <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to clinical findings the evolution of laboratory data during follow up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact <EOS>
<SOS> characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis but also by the myeloid stromal compartment <EOS>
<SOS> while the megakaryocyte rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia cml and the 5q syndrome mds are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes in polycythemia vera pv this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance <EOS>
<SOS> in essential thrombocythemia et a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated staghorn like nuclei may be encountered <EOS>
<SOS> a clear cut discrimination of et from early hypercellular stages of idiopathic primary myelofibrosis imf presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account <EOS>
<SOS> moreover cml displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas pv shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation involving erythropoiesis in particular <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in cml and to a lesser degree also in imf <EOS>
<SOS> in cmpds extreme values of iron deposits may be found ranging from a total lack pv to minor amounts cml and a normal staining reaction et <EOS>
<SOS> similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis which is usually not present in et rarely observed in pv and detectable to a variable degree in cml and imf <EOS>
<SOS> nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> this benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 56 year old patient who underwent breast biopsy followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of <NUM> of <NUM> identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction <EOS>
<SOS> strong immunohistological staining for the s 100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection <NUM> days after kidney transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> cramp like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> enemas did not relieve the symptoms and the following laparotomoy with tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed <EOS>
<SOS> further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella zoster virus was isolated from their fluid <EOS>
<SOS> despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died <NUM> days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure <EOS>
<SOS> the unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> after checking vital signs deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation an intravenous line must be established blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given <EOS>
<SOS> the physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points best reaction to loud commands best motor reaction to noxious stimuli respiratory pattern size and reactions of pupils eye movements corneal and blink reflex meningismus muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes <EOS>
<SOS> with this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed <EOS>
<SOS> a severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28 of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system cns diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in any atypical alcoholic delirium especially with focal neurological signs partial seizures or decreased level of consciousness cns diseases like meningoencephalitis intracranial hemorrhage or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography ct scan and cerebral spinal fluid csf tap <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic and prognostic value of ct scan and csf analysis was examined in <NUM> persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens <EOS>
<SOS> neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> blood csf barrier permeability is increased in 70 of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral atrophy as shown in ct scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course <EOS>
<SOS> in our experience ct examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium <EOS>
<SOS> recently an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed <EOS>
<SOS> one component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall <EOS>
<SOS> the membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin cartilage or fascia avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time <EOS>
<SOS> in the study presented here the microphone was implanted into <NUM> cadaver specimens of human temporal bone <EOS>
<SOS> localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve <EOS>
<SOS> the microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78 of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy <EOS>
<SOS> in the final version of the microphone the size was <NUM> mm and total weight <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> collagen vascular diseases representing systemic soft tissue disorders may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract <EOS>
<SOS> the type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities <EOS>
<SOS> this survey describes the chest radiographic and in particular high resolution computed tomographic hrct findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract <EOS>
<SOS> it includes fibrosing alveolitis alveolitis interstitial pneumonia pulmonary fibrosis and bronchial bronchitis bronchiolitis bronchiectasis pleural and vascular manifestations as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis pss scleroderma systemic lupus erythematosus sle mixed connective tissue disease mctd sharp syndrome sjögren syndrome overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis ra <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in pss acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in sle lymphoproliferative disease in sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in ra <EOS>
<SOS> the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders eating disorders or hysterical symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence <EOS>
<SOS> dissociation with induced depersonalisation derealisation and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience <EOS>
<SOS> unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders substance abuse self harming behaviour or social acting out <EOS>
<SOS> against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of guided affective imagery <EOS>
<SOS> in the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource oriented approach <EOS>
<SOS> the actual trauma therapy consists of a gradual leading up to the traumatic scenes through consistent minimally retraumatizing confrontation followed by consolation and the ability to let go <EOS>
<SOS> in the final phase there is a return to resource oriented creativity and concrete life planning <EOS>
<SOS> all patients of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the erfurt hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of <NUM> years from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this included questions concerning frequency seriousness and treatment of these infections social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course <EOS>
<SOS> odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections <EOS>
<SOS> aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and <NUM> fungi can be involved <EOS>
<SOS> cephalosporine aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with lactamase inhibitor alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic <EOS>
<SOS> hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector <EOS>
<SOS> comparison of hospitals is legally required bpflv § 5 to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener while also objectivizing it <EOS>
<SOS> if comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics no <EOS>
<SOS> of cases days of care length of stay case lump sums and special fees <EOS>
<SOS> documentation of particular features of the patient population the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level <EOS>
<SOS> with rising costs the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service <EOS>
<SOS> hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital is own situation with regard to performance quality efficiency and patient satisfaction but can also provide a basis for structural planning <EOS>
<SOS> the fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients the doctors who refer them and the visitors <EOS>
<SOS> if hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level <EOS>
<SOS> this would be bad for the patient and in view of the consequent costs also for the overall costs in the health care sector <EOS>
<SOS> against the backdrop of a future performance related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one is own costs that has been in place hitherto openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in <NUM> patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy <EOS>
<SOS> on average <NUM> lymph nodes were resected in each patient and <NUM> patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1 9 lymph nodes <EOS>
<SOS> after an initial learning curve mean operative time was reduced significantly allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one stage procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the overall complication rate was <NUM> open revisions were necessary in only <NUM> of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative hospital stay was <NUM> days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only <EOS>
<SOS> this minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence <EOS>
<SOS> taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed the localizing the metaphorical and the modelling relation <EOS>
<SOS> the need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early at the same time it is argued that after the dismissal of the old metapsychology this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism <EOS>
<SOS> following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus special post operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results <EOS>
<SOS> proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon physical therapists and nurses <EOS>
<SOS> only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve <EOS>
<SOS> we describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors extensors muscles in the hand <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence of type i allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire prick tests and the determination of specific ige antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in <NUM> 8 7 of <NUM> students with clinical relevance in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> when the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2 in the second semester to 10 4 in the tenth semester was seen <EOS>
<SOS> a history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal and flare reaction was associated with a type i allergy against latex in only 50 of the affected subjects <EOS>
<SOS> atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in <NUM> and <NUM> of <NUM> students with latex allergy respectively <EOS>
<SOS> a high ammonia accelerator free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific ige antibodies to latex <EOS>
<SOS> gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to tumor relapse the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages radiogenic stenosis adhesions may also be the cause for the obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> the main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery <EOS>
<SOS> if this is not possible because of advanced intra abdominal tumor expansion several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods and drugs are available that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient is condition <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a 60 year old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma t3n2cm0 and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented <EOS>

<SOS> planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of baden württemberg <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment success of ncpap therapy nasal continuous positive airway pressure depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of <URL> complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and together with problems of mask application are among the primary factors causing an ncpap therapy to be prematurely discontinued <EOS>
<SOS> the foramen ovale is anatomically open in <NUM> of individuals but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum <EOS>
<SOS> right to left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises for example as a result of pulmonary embolism <EOS>
<SOS> in the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented <NUM> days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word finding deficits <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral mrt revealed a fresh ischemic insult <EOS>
<SOS> duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism <EOS>
<SOS> transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous open foramen ovale <EOS>
<SOS> duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings <EOS>
<SOS> deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically unconspicuous and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from paradox embolism and cerebral ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life threatening injuries recognition of serious organ lesions and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact as well as the resulting host reaction <EOS>
<SOS> besides improvements in the structure and organization major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room <EOS>
<SOS> systematic diagnostic work up integrated multidisciplinary approach and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management <EOS>
<SOS> in particular diagnostic work up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> pheochromocytomas are functionally active catecholamine secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine <EOS>
<SOS> this drug irreversibly alkylates alpha 1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional thereby causing vasodilatation <EOS>
<SOS> the duration of action of a single dose is approximately <NUM> h therefore postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided <EOS>
<SOS> prazosin a short acting competitive alpha 1 blocker has been used preoperatively but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes <EOS>
<SOS> case report case presentation of a 59 year old female patient who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid <EOS>

<SOS> we present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus <EOS>
<SOS> occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia <EOS>
<SOS> therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> this type of lung conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before <EOS>
<SOS> 545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis urethritis were examined between november <NUM> and december <NUM> in the department of dermatology and venerology of the military hospital in ulm <EOS>
<SOS> the patients aged from <NUM> to <NUM> years mean age <NUM> years were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the use of the kaufman assessment battery for children k abc was evaluated with a sample of <NUM> mentally disabled adults in a wide age range as there exist no special tests for this group of patients <EOS>
<SOS> intercorrelation and factor analyses and correlations with the german adaptation of the wechsler adult intelligence scale hawie r proved the use of the k abc to be valid <EOS>
<SOS> as an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2 6 to 12 5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults the k abc delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses based on a neuropsychological theory <EOS>
<SOS> thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation and that gives an important base for intervention partial remediation and placement <EOS>

<SOS> all biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the mx physicians <EOS>
<SOS> biopsy recommendations were acted upon in <NUM> of cases within <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of the dignity mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical procedure was known in the doctors offices in <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> specimen radiographies were not done regularly <EOS>
<SOS> a pathology report was available overall in <NUM> of <NUM> malignant cases respectively <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of the histological diagnosis itself no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely <EOS>
<SOS> only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely <EOS>
<SOS> fail safe information are requested by mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations <EOS>
<SOS> a regional quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation <EOS>
<SOS> the high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in a 13 year period <NUM> out of <NUM> patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the was being left in situ on an average of <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> after an observation period of at least <NUM> months a recurrence was seen in <NUM> of these <NUM> patients 3 9 causes volvulus after <NUM> months fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day <EOS>
<SOS> amongst the <NUM> non splinted patients recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in <NUM> cases 18 6 causes adhesions after <MOB> months <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted <EOS>
<SOS> complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we report the results of minimally avr compared to the conventional method performed in the same period <EOS>
<SOS> from may <NUM> to january 1998 <NUM> patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy group 1 <EOS>
<SOS> as a control group group 2 <NUM> patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period <EOS>
<SOS> av synchrony and rate responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence <EOS>
<SOS> however their importance throughout low levels of exercise is poorly evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> we studied <NUM> patients with implanted dual chamber pacemakers telectronics meta 1254 concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of <NUM> w lite protocol <EOS>
<SOS> each patient was tested in vvir dd and ddr mode <EOS>
<SOS> all av delays were constant at 160ms <EOS>
<SOS> the oxygen deficit o2d mean response time mrt for oxygen uptake and a oxygen deficit index o2di were determined <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the heart rate hr and bloodpressure were monitored <EOS>
<SOS> results significant differences p0 01 were observed in hr and o2d when comparing both dd to vvir and dd to ddr modes <EOS>
<SOS> comparing the randomly synchronous vvir to the ddr mode only the mrt of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the ddr mode p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> there were also significant decreases in o2di and mrt in the ddr mode as compared to the non rate responsive dd mode p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> stress testing in pm patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that av synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate adaptive pacing <EOS>

<SOS> introduction results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non cemented prostheses can at the very least temporarily be impaired by the application of non steroidal antiphlogistic agents such as diclofenac <EOS>
<SOS> it is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages 3 times <NUM> mg daily on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> methods to investigate this cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications <EOS>
<SOS> our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines <EOS>
<SOS> the measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet voltaren <NUM> reached 1 6µg ml <EOS>
<SOS> this correlated with diclofenac concentrations between <NUM> and <NUM> ml found in our experiments <EOS>
<SOS> the detected values were correlated to the control group 0 µg ml diclofenac <EOS>
<SOS> results the drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells <EOS>
<SOS> the proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells compared to untreated cells was found to be decreased <EOS>
<SOS> we observed a decrease to 82 at a diclofenac concentration of <NUM> µg ml osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97 5 at the same concentration <EOS>
<SOS> the dna synthesis increased to 118 in stromal bone marrow cells in osteoblasts to 144 <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast we detected a neglectible decrease to 92 in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells <EOS>
<SOS> the synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119 <EOS>
<SOS> the alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88 in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 11 <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression <EOS>
<SOS> osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic persistent infection by chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> the main arguments for chlamydial genesis are correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against chlamydia pneumoniae <EOS>
<SOS> 2 chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques pcr icc immunhistology electromicroscopy culture in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites <EOS>
<SOS> 3 according to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> 4 target cells of atherosclerosis endothelia macrophages muscle cells can be infected by chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> 5 provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments <EOS>
<SOS> 6 the reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> 7 elevated levels of acute phase proteins and other inflammatory signs crp wbc count fibrinogin briefly before cardiac infarction occurs <EOS>
<SOS> there are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> the relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe <EOS>
<SOS> meticulous protocols and long term monitoring of patients should be developed <EOS>
<SOS> the pre and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow up study to prepare a classification proposal <EOS>
<SOS> a differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal <EOS>
<SOS> therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture <EOS>
<SOS> the aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients were examined <EOS>
<SOS> after the operation on average after <NUM> days following the trauma they were followed up postoperatively for <NUM> months according to a strict schedule <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively <NUM> patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve <EOS>
<SOS> other symptoms such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence were observed in <NUM> patients and <NUM> patients respectively <EOS>
<SOS> all fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically <EOS>
<SOS> the aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> six months postoperatively <NUM> patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve <EOS>
<SOS> in only five patients 10 2 was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period <EOS>
<SOS> it can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim <EOS>
<SOS> an additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary <EOS>
<SOS> a routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia <EOS>
<SOS> a zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic orbital floor fracture <EOS>
<SOS> chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> to date this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the german language <EOS>
<SOS> in america a headache specific questionnaire the headache disability inventory hdi has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a german version the inventar zur beeinträchtigung durch kopfschmerzen ibk <EOS>
<SOS> 94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder 59 female <NUM> male mean age <NUM> <NUM> years were examined <EOS>
<SOS> cronbach is alpha was a 0 90 the test retest reliability after three months was r 0 87 <EOS>
<SOS> an analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test retest reliability of these subscales <EOS>
<SOS> the scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly <EOS>
<SOS> in post hoc analyses however cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales <EOS>
<SOS> the total score of the ibk was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month r 0 41 p<MOB> but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the ibk is the first german headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients <EOS>
<SOS> it can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies <EOS>
<SOS> age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast <EOS>
<SOS> this well known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists <EOS>
<SOS> the number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging however is surprisingly low <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and mr mammography <EOS>
<SOS> therefore own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic mr mammography <EOS>
<SOS> literature data are used to correlate mammography and mr imaging findings with these influences <EOS>
<SOS> the changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and mr mammography <EOS>
<SOS> the knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods <EOS>
<SOS> finally the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo <EOS>
<SOS> as part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on <URL> dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non specific appendicitis however suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis therefore can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper <EOS>
<SOS> special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy <EOS>
<SOS> extra articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint genu varum or valgum are treatments proven over many years <EOS>
<SOS> the middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores <EOS>
<SOS> the good results by infra and supracondylar osteotomies some of them for <NUM> years and more have to be achieved by prosthesis first <EOS>
<SOS> the important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning the miss load and the instability of the joint these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency <EOS>
<SOS> therefore indication of infra or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the most important fact is the condition of the joint especially the quality of bone the instability of the joint and the loss of bone <EOS>
<SOS> given the right indication the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint <EOS>
<SOS> also there are still chances to do another operation such a prothesis <EOS>
<SOS> a prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint <EOS>
<SOS> psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation <EOS>
<SOS> differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations pes is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur <EOS>
<SOS> this article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine <EOS>
<SOS> a definition is offered to outline pes that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho social reasons <EOS>
<SOS> for the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented <EOS>
<SOS> acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses <EOS>
<SOS> whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1 nowadays still approximately 20 of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease <EOS>
<SOS> to further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used <EOS>
<SOS> for effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial <EOS>
<SOS> all patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a ct scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> primarily all patients are treated conservatively <EOS>
<SOS> main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> objective diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease <EOS>
<SOS> usually characteristic x ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease <EOS>
<SOS> sonography scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> a 73 year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy hocm since <NUM> <EOS>

<SOS> as a consequence of this casuistry pseudo myectomy caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of hocm <EOS>
<SOS> aim intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes type i <EOS>
<SOS> intensified insulin therapy includes an basis bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion several times daily blood glucose self monitoring self adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far reaching liberalization of nutrition <EOS>
<SOS> the patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program <EOS>
<SOS> the effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over <NUM> <NUM> ° cobb during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity vertebral rotation rigidity of the curve the skeletal age the age and sex of the patient the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve <EOS>
<SOS> in scoliosis over <NUM> <NUM> ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period <EOS>
<SOS> progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses especially in young patients risser sign <NUM> and 1 <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to evaluate low field magnetic resonance imaging mri with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist <EOS>
<SOS> between august <NUM> and may 1997 <NUM> patients at the unfallchirurgische universitätsklinik mainz germany with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination x ray and mri imaging <EOS>
<SOS> mri analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying mri experience without knowledge of the patient is history <EOS>
<SOS> the sensitivity and specifity of the more u1 and the less experienced u2 radiologist ranged from <NUM> to 100 u1 and from <NUM> to 100 u2 <EOS>
<SOS> positive and negative predictive value ranged from <NUM> to 100 u1 and from <NUM> to 100 u2 accuracy ranged from <NUM> to 100 u1 and from <NUM> to 100 u1 <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that the results of low field mri are comparable with those of high field mri and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established <EOS>
<SOS> in intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the ldl cholesterol and an increase in hdl cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death angina or heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> changes of lifestyle can be effective but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate <EOS>
<SOS> dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> in departments of dermatology german speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58 from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked <EOS>
<SOS> out patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to <NUM> dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40 6 in the number of operative procedures they performed <EOS>
<SOS> the importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin <EOS>
<SOS> there is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance <EOS>
<SOS> intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography tee enables doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern e a ratio <EOS>
<SOS> the e a ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we compared the time course of the e a ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass cpb <EOS>
<SOS> after ethical approval <NUM> patients undergoing cabg surgery were studied <EOS>
<SOS> measurements of the e a ratio and <NUM> were performed after induction of anesthesia i immediately prior to cpb with the pericardium open ii <NUM> min after cpb ii and after sternal closure iv <EOS>
<SOS> time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dp dt and left ventricular pressure plot <EOS>
<SOS> the e a ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery iv <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast <NUM> was increased immediately after cpb but decreased after sternal closure iv <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac index and heart rate both increased after cpb <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after cpb as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation <EOS>
<SOS> however <NUM> improved rapidly to pre cpb values <EOS>
<SOS> the e a ratio alone failed to detect the initial post cpb alteration in left ventricular relaxation <EOS>
<SOS> acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol <EOS>
<SOS> nk cells react the most intensive they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise <EOS>
<SOS> additionally a weak acute phase reaction occurs <EOS>
<SOS> most of these changes normalize during twenty four hours <EOS>
<SOS> parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre exercise levels up to seventy two hours <EOS>
<SOS> repeated physical exercise which is typical for sports is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest <EOS>
<SOS> epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j shaped curve <EOS>
<SOS> moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection <EOS>
<SOS> for this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important <EOS>
<SOS> especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue which remove destructed tissue <EOS>
<SOS> not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues <EOS>
<SOS> to achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum even in cases of marked deviations or severe post traumatic deformities we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a compound graft <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate <EOS>
<SOS> as connecting material we use a polydioxanon pds foil <EOS>
<SOS> the sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with pds suture material <EOS>
<SOS> the compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose <EOS>
<SOS> the pds and suture material are usually resorbed within <NUM> months excluding long term complications <EOS>
<SOS> during the past <NUM> years this method was used in treating <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical goal was attained in every case and no immediate or long term complications occurred <EOS>
<SOS> this method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better significant correction of even severe septal deviations <EOS>
<SOS> two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical hpa axis <EOS>
<SOS> these glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the mineralocorticoid receptor mr and the glucocorticoid receptor gr <EOS>
<SOS> evidently a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges <EOS>
<SOS> here we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in mr density in the hippocampus a limbic structure highly involved in hpa axis regulation after an acute psychologically stressful challenge <EOS>
<SOS> this rise in mr is accompanied by a stronger mr mediated inhibitory control of the hpa axis <EOS>
<SOS> thus an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the hpa axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal mr <EOS>
<SOS> this novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress related disorders <EOS>
<SOS> the wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain <EOS>
<SOS> until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency in spite of this fact neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency <EOS>
<SOS> a metaanalysis was performed and <NUM> publications reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> thirty four the majority of the studies are case reports retrospective analyses or non randomised cohort studies <EOS>
<SOS> most of these reports attest to a positive effect <EOS>
<SOS> however only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect <EOS>
<SOS> none of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used <EOS>
<SOS> the metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics <EOS>
<SOS> studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within <NUM> hours from symptom onset <EOS>
<SOS> for most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> many factors are responsible for this time delay signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff <EOS>
<SOS> although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education <EOS>
<SOS> for the future we hope that emergency medical services ems will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke <EOS>
<SOS> standard of care by the ems personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia <EOS>
<SOS> early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients <EOS>
<SOS> a decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or wrapping may lead to a partial loss of the arterial windkessel function <EOS>
<SOS> the following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> pigs the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis <EOS>
<SOS> this approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta like extracorporal circulation cardioplegia or blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention and following fourier transformation the aortic input impedance was calculated <EOS>
<SOS> mean pressure mean flow and total peripheral resistance were unaltered while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the wrapping procedure <EOS>
<SOS> thus it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load <EOS>
<SOS> cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology <EOS>
<SOS> there are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists <EOS>
<SOS> to gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy fnp <EOS>
<SOS> if there is no reliable result it is necessary to remove a lymph node <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis x in lymph nodes <EOS>
<SOS> a 63 year old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about <NUM> weeks previously <EOS>
<SOS> the preliminary examinations fnp blood examinations revealed no pathological findings <EOS>
<SOS> only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis x <EOS>
<SOS> systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations <EOS>
<SOS> no further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation <EOS>
<SOS> the report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease <EOS>
<SOS> we report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract <EOS>
<SOS> using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta acetic acid dtpa we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography <EOS>
<SOS> the major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization the excretion of gadolinium dtpa can be studied simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> we demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases <EOS>
<SOS> microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques <EOS>
<SOS> histologically these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae <EOS>
<SOS> using a preparation technique that allows combined two and threedimensional analysis <NUM> normal human spines and <NUM> osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus <EOS>
<SOS> microcallus formations occur frequently in people over <NUM> years of age <EOS>
<SOS> they are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males <EOS>
<SOS> the number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters <EOS>
<SOS> in about <NUM> of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation <EOS>
<SOS> in noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus <EOS>
<SOS> although it indicates instability of the bone structure microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> it stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae <EOS>
<SOS> osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus <EOS>
<SOS> dna cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the detection of a dna aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high grade malignant bone neoplasm even in small biopsies <EOS>
<SOS> solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have dna diploid cell populations <EOS>
<SOS> low grade central osteosarcomas may show single cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a dna diploid stemline <EOS>
<SOS> their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a dna aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation <EOS>
<SOS> although noise in general can induce hearing loss environmental noise represents an important risk for children teenagers and young adults <EOS>
<SOS> epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups <EOS>
<SOS> major causes of hearing loss are toys guns explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts <EOS>
<SOS> the development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint <EOS>
<SOS> one of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability <EOS>
<SOS> state of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations <EOS>
<SOS> the arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools <EOS>

<SOS> three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented <EOS>
<SOS> neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low risk surgical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a case of a <NUM> years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident <EOS>
<SOS> he survived with excellent clinical outcome but after <NUM> days after the accident he collapsed massive bleeding out of the mouths started and the patient died within a few minutes <EOS>
<SOS> a gastric ulcer bleeding was assumed but autopsy showed the beak in of a posttraumatic aortic aneurysm into the esophagus <EOS>
<SOS> the difficulties of in time diagnosis of thoracic aorta lesions are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia ol in hiv positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of candida hyphae and viral infections hsv 1 2 hpv ebv and cmv by immunocytochemical methods using mono or polyclonal antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> hiv seropositive patients 22 men median age <NUM> years and <NUM> women median age <NUM> years were registered <EOS>
<SOS> ol occurred in 20 269 7 4 patients men smokers median age <NUM> years the non homogeneous form was observed in 11 <EOS>
<SOS> a lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8 20 patients <EOS>
<SOS> specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia <EOS>
<SOS> candida hyphae were evident in 2 8 cases <EOS>
<SOS> two patients tested positive for hpv and cmv antibodies against ebv hsv1 and <NUM> were negative <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the prevalence of ol is comparatively high in this group of hiv seropositive patients 7 4 vs <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for ol was lower 38 years vs <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> damage dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods in sepsis and sirs <EOS>
<SOS> this acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance although about 10 of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> this potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure not primarily ischemic with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance <EOS>
<SOS> damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ards <EOS>
<SOS> sirs cardiomyopathy in non infectious mods has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and sirs is multifactorial the endotoxin tnf no cgmp cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis <EOS>
<SOS> therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and sirs cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic volume substitution inotropic vasoactive agents causal therapeutic principles are however put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle <EOS>
<SOS> intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation with good ultimate functional outcome <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and december 1995 a prospective study on <NUM> patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed <EOS>
<SOS> all the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> men and <NUM> women with an average age of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> years range 21 90 <EOS>
<SOS> in most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a new classification according to robinson et al <EOS>
<SOS> 1995 was used <NUM> fractures were type ii b 20 4 <NUM> were type ii c 26 5 and <NUM> patients suffered a combination of type ii b and type ii c 53 1 <EOS>
<SOS> this fracture type was defined as type ii d for use in this study <EOS>
<SOS> the severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the gustilo system in case of open n 19 and the tscherne system in case of closed fractures n 30 <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula which was first stablized using a plate <EOS>
<SOS> for reconstruction of the distal articular surface covered screw osteosynthesis was done <EOS>
<SOS> at the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> to february 1994 the reamed ao standard nail was used <EOS>
<SOS> after introduction of the unreamed tibial nail utn all fractures were treated by this implant <EOS>
<SOS> full load on the operated leg was allowed after <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria <EOS>
<SOS> misalignment was defined as more than <NUM> <NUM> ° of angular rotation <EOS>
<SOS> further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases <EOS>
<SOS> there were no deep infections <EOS>
<SOS> three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area but surgical debridement was not necessary <EOS>
<SOS> a leg shortening was found in <NUM> cases but it was less than <NUM> cm in every case <EOS>
<SOS> therefore surgical correction was not done <EOS>
<SOS> patients were reviewed at intervals of 2 6 and <NUM> weeks and after 6 and at least <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> all <NUM> patients were finally reviewed after an average time of <NUM> months range 12 38 <EOS>
<SOS> bone fusion was reached <NUM> weeks range 9 21 after the operative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> a specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of olerud and molander 1984 <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients excellent results were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> a satisfactory result was attained with <NUM> patients and just <NUM> patients were found to be unsatisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation <EOS>
<SOS> the major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques <EOS>
<SOS> therefore closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture <EOS>
<SOS> laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract <EOS>
<SOS> the lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and given its rarity may be confused with cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in the present paper we report on a 56 year old male patient who presented with hoarseness <EOS>
<SOS> physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient ten bottles of beer and <NUM> cigarettes per day generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma however it could not provide a clear diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis which had been suspected could be excluded <EOS>
<SOS> as the lesion progressed further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis <EOS>
<SOS> systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission <EOS>
<SOS> lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor <EOS>
<SOS> metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions but this is unpredictable <EOS>
<SOS> the number of lymph nodes in each position varies <EOS>
<SOS> therefore systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum <EOS>
<SOS> it is also possible to reach contralateral sites <EOS>
<SOS> in right sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized <EOS>
<SOS> mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left sided approach <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical technique is described <EOS>
<SOS> perioperative morbidity does not increase <EOS>
<SOS> systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pn stage <EOS>
<SOS> the stage related survival rate is significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> in the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo orchitis <EOS>
<SOS> a special case of a thirty eight year old male asylant from nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain <EOS>
<SOS> to exclude testicular torsion a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation <EOS>
<SOS> under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear <EOS>
<SOS> a filaricide medication with diethylcarbamacine citran was administered with good symptomatic relief <EOS>
<SOS> we studied <NUM> patients with parkinson is disease and <NUM> patients with parkinson plus syndrome trying to improve patients gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli including metronome stimulation 96 beats per minute middle andante <EOS>
<SOS> the test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and <NUM> u turns <EOS>
<SOS> the patients gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk velocity number of steps number of freezing episodes <EOS>
<SOS> metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes <EOS>
<SOS> march music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation rhythmically tapping on the patient is shoulder even produced negative results <EOS>
<SOS> the positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building but outside in the hospital parc <EOS>
<SOS> metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub groups examined in this study m parkinson parkinson plus syndrome and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> electronical metronomes are not expensive easy in handling and portable <EOS>
<SOS> a theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with parkinson is disease still needs to be elucidated <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy <EOS>
<SOS> chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion <EOS>
<SOS> the important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their ductular morphology without atypia <EOS>
<SOS> objectives repair of acute rupture of the achilles tendon through a percutaneous technique under general regional or local anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to progestational hormonal stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> less frequently deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital endometriosis visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with acute lbp the effect of manual therapy was examined <EOS>
<SOS> the examination was conducted with the triflexometer which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine <EOS>
<SOS> this instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement <EOS>
<SOS> in our study we measured the spine from c7 to s2 in the sagittal and frontal planes <EOS>
<SOS> improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy as well as in ante retro and lateral flexion on both sides and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally <EOS>
<SOS> our study shows that the triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute lbp <EOS>
<SOS> the proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute lbp or perhaps of chronic lbp and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri and postoperative complications <EOS>
<SOS> sonography with color duplex imaging is the method of choice in the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection <EOS>
<SOS> mri is an additional method in the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction especially in diagnosis of perirenal fluid collections <EOS>
<SOS> mr angiography and mr urography are noninvasive diagnostic modalities with the potential to replace angiography and pyelography <EOS>
<SOS> angiography complemented by carbon dioxide angiography still is the gold standard in the diagnosis of transplant artery stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall <EOS>
<SOS> the resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the gut associated lymphatic tissue galt <EOS>
<SOS> glutamine is the main oxidative substrate of enterocytes and an important nitrogen donor its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients <EOS>
<SOS> the amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of no and polyamine synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short chain fatty acids mainly acetic propionic and butyric acid <EOS>
<SOS> the trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow <EOS>
<SOS> among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> patients with a total of <NUM> angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded duplex sonography tccd during a time period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined <EOS>
<SOS> seventy aneurysms 77 with a diameter of <NUM> <NUM> mm 6 55mm were detectable with excellent visualization in <NUM> 42 moderate visualization in <NUM> 40 and no sufficient visualization in <NUM> 16 aneurysms respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in another <NUM> cases 16 there was no sufficient vone window <EOS>
<SOS> thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16 20 cases 75 visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12 25 patients 48 <EOS>
<SOS> tccd allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization <EOS>
<SOS> the method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms <EOS>
<SOS> the authors report the case of a young patient suffering from plasmacellular osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine a unusual localisation of this type of chronic osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> they discuss the role of imaging diagnostic modalities in this disease focussing on mri <EOS>
<SOS> the heidelberg retina tomograph hrt is a new instrument to analyze the three dimensional structure of the retina <EOS>
<SOS> it is based on confocal laser scanning technology <EOS>
<SOS> scientific interest has so far focused on the follow up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage <EOS>
<SOS> as parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of three patients aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth <EOS>
<SOS> a combination of a typical history endoscopy laboratory radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used <EOS>
<SOS> all patients had preexisting intestinal disease two former premature infants had been operated several times because of necrotizing enterocolitis including resection of larger parts of small bowel <EOS>
<SOS> the third patient was suffering from pancolonic hirschsprung is disease <EOS>
<SOS> all patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole <EOS>
<SOS> discussion small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods <EOS>
<SOS> direct bacteriologic analysis is difficult <EOS>
<SOS> usually antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to carotid endarterectomy the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study including <NUM> patients it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic procedures included dsa cct mri <NUM> h ecg otoneurological and neurological examination and ultrasonic flow measurement <EOS>
<SOS> we compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> two different surgical procedures were used transposition of the vertebral artery to the cca or graft implantation between cca and atlas loop <EOS>
<SOS> in the follow up period 6 <NUM> months 72 of the patients had improved or were without complaints <EOS>
<SOS> the validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery <EOS>
<SOS> it has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> a three dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility <EOS>
<SOS> in situations of depressed myocardial function the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently <EOS>
<SOS> in different pathophysiological situations such as chronic heart failure open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation cardiac transplantation myocardial infarction and angina pectoris patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor interleukin 1 interleukin 6 and reversible myocardial dysfunction which may represent a final common pathway <EOS>
<SOS> the available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function i e contractility preload afterload and heart rate by cytokines <EOS>
<SOS> potential mechanisms include the adrenoceptor and nitric oxide pathway as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis <EOS>
<SOS> interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups <EOS>
<SOS> the first group was permitted to shower postoperatively allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry <EOS>
<SOS> water contact wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed <EOS>
<SOS> there was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection <EOS>
<SOS> in children and adolescents motor vocal tics and obsessive compulsive behavior are known to be closely related <EOS>
<SOS> thereby a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics rituals obsessive compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described <EOS>
<SOS> as neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico striato thalamo cortical circuits sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive compulsive behavior were postulated <EOS>
<SOS> for both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive compulsive behavior respectively and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems <EOS>
<SOS> in case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> as laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established interest in legal aspects increases <EOS>
<SOS> the legal cases dealt with in germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in <NUM> were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications <EOS>
<SOS> of <NUM> cases <NUM> were judged to be cases of malpractice whereas <NUM> were not <EOS>
<SOS> the most common cause was injury of the common bile duct 26 cases <EOS>
<SOS> seven of these <NUM> cases were judged to be cases of malpractice <NUM> of these as grave errors <EOS>
<SOS> the main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy delayed revision laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations <EOS>
<SOS> purpose of this review is to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> there is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation brain death concept donor consent and organ allocation <EOS>
<SOS> transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability <EOS>
<SOS> organ donor rate of <NUM> to <NUM> donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy <EOS>
<SOS> 15 to <NUM> liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year my be sufficient to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases <EOS>
<SOS> this frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing split techniques where one liver is used for two recipients <EOS>
<SOS> one year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between <NUM> and <NUM> one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the risk of organ failure is highest in the first year long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection comorbidity of the patient and original disease <EOS>
<SOS> patient and or graft loss after the first year is in the order of <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> whole organ transplantation for kidneys hearts and livers are considered routine procedures lung transplantation is reaching standard phase pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically but its indication is still controversial <EOS>
<SOS> laser induced interstitial thermotherapy litt is a promising method of treating different types of tumors <EOS>
<SOS> to increase the effectiveness of litt a new thermo controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed <EOS>
<SOS> this laser system consists of a laser applicator <NUM> mm in diameter insertion equipment and an nd yag laser source <EOS>
<SOS> the power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water cooling system of the laser applicator <EOS>
<SOS> in in vivo experiments in five pigs within <NUM> min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of <NUM> cm and <NUM> cm in diameter <EOS>
<SOS> via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo <EOS>
<SOS> however due to perifocal edema the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> macroscopically and microscopically the coagulation zones showed well demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions and the surrounding tissue appeared vital <EOS>
<SOS> the reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of <NUM> weeks the surrounding scar capsule containing fibrocytes biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged <EOS>
<SOS> as a result the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed <EOS>
<SOS> the absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable <EOS>
<SOS> attachment theory originally developed by john bowlby becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy research <EOS>
<SOS> this review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment mainly from research in developmental psychology <EOS>
<SOS> related to adults attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper <EOS>
<SOS> finally some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies these will be the content of the part <NUM> of this review <EOS>
<SOS> inflammation mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> we found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process in addition cytokines are increased <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation <EOS>
<SOS> the beneficial effects of anxiolytics however appear to be difficult to prove <EOS>
<SOS> in this study a comparison was made of heart rate hr blood pressure bp and norepinephrine epinephrine and cortisol levels <EOS>
<SOS> in group i <NUM> children recieved only psychological treatment while in group ii <NUM> children received <NUM> mg kg midazolam orally <EOS>
<SOS> measuring points were directly before medication <NUM> min afterward and at induction of anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> during the observation period the patients 5 10 years old remained calm <EOS>
<SOS> at the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range <NUM> min after premedication the hr and bp were significantly higher in group i than in group ii <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to group i epinephrine levels in group ii were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication <EOS>
<SOS> in both groups norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication <EOS>
<SOS> cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam <EOS>
<SOS> hr bp as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of <NUM> mg kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children <EOS>
<SOS> a case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid <EOS>
<SOS> this is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of hepatitis a infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in germany <EOS>
<SOS> however hepatitis a is one of the most important diseases imported to the country <EOS>
<SOS> currently more than the half of all registered hepatitis a infections are acquired in foreign countries <EOS>
<SOS> according to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people age below <NUM> years are not immunized and subsequently this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a hepatitis a vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis a southern europe africa south america and asia <EOS>
<SOS> lactic acid bacteria lab are a group of gram positive organism which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end product <EOS>
<SOS> except for bifidobacteria the lab are phylogenetically closely related <EOS>
<SOS> they directly contribute to human well being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet <EOS>
<SOS> they are furthermore an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora <EOS>
<SOS> the genus streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs <EOS>
<SOS> the intestinal flora contains such species of the genus lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore can be found exclusively in this ecological niche <EOS>
<SOS> a special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci <EOS>
<SOS> the former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines <EOS>
<SOS> enterococci are rather ubiquitous participate in indigenous food fermentations are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens <EOS>
<SOS> to influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects lab are isolated from the intestinal flora grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food usually fermented milk <EOS>
<SOS> these bacteria are termed probiotics <EOS>
<SOS> the exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health <EOS>
<SOS> in this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion <EOS>
<SOS> in front of this background lab in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe nevertheless some restrictions have to be made <EOS>
<SOS> generally the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> in addition they should not produce biogenic amines e g <EOS>
<SOS> histamine tyrosine or phenylethylamine and should not degrade mucine <EOS>
<SOS> the assessment may also include the following absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine <EOS>
<SOS> these examinations may be required as certain lab have been identified in clinical isolates <EOS>
<SOS> the isolates were however obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients <EOS>
<SOS> the germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated <EOS>
<SOS> dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> due to the nonspecific symptomatology as well as the manifold etiology clinical diagnosis may be difficult <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical ct in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with clinically suspected thrombosis ct angiography was performed <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> in order to acquire also arterial vessels a short delay of about <NUM> s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected <EOS>
<SOS> by this method we found an occlusion of the mca in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an empty delta sign <EOS>
<SOS> with irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus <EOS>
<SOS> the mip reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage <EOS>
<SOS> in three patients mr angiograms were available for comparison <EOS>
<SOS> the smaller veins such as the v vermis inferior were less clearly depicted than in ct angiography <EOS>
<SOS> ct angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> it can be performed immediately after non enhanced ct <EOS>
<SOS> according to our present experience ct angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries however <EOS>
<SOS> with intravascular ultrasound on the other hand pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded <EOS>
<SOS> despite typical symptoms an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> in such cases intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings <EOS>
<SOS> two cases are used to illustrate this <EOS>
<SOS> in those angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear <EOS>
<SOS> the cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions <EOS>
<SOS> the present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by eeg power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned <EOS>
<SOS> we also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation ives therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity <EOS>
<SOS> background indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe potential vision threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in general any therapy has been dis cussed controversially in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma high dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma <EOS>
<SOS> the usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock like syndrome tsls in otherwise healthy adults <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by fever rash hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal tsls <EOS>
<SOS> various aspects of the pathophysiology diagnosis and therapy are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> only early aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby in combination with antibiotic therapy decrease the high mortality of this entity <EOS>

<SOS> the risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of <NUM> min produces health related benefits recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites climbing stairs brisk walking and cycling can have a benedicial effects on health particularly in those who take little exercise <EOS>
<SOS> so now the recommendation is exercise of moderate intensity lasting <NUM> min at least <NUM> times a week corresponding to an energy consumption of about <NUM> kacl day or <NUM> kcal week <EOS>
<SOS> the results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle <EOS>
<SOS> for one thing it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis for another sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life <EOS>
<SOS> the new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement <EOS>
<SOS> more difficult however is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity <EOS>
<SOS> a model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling transtheoretical model can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy <EOS>
<SOS> depending on whether an individual is inactive or sporadically or regularly active each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle <EOS>
<SOS> assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity the patient is attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically <EOS>
<SOS> background photorefraktive keratectomy prk is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide <EOS>
<SOS> the central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma including bowman is layer with a laser beam <EOS>

<SOS> beginning in the 1920s wilhelm reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> he started from considerations of egopathology sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns <EOS>
<SOS> characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence patterns against emotions which function not only psychologically but also bodily <EOS>
<SOS> thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions <EOS>
<SOS> that way their meaning in the person is history could be understood and a self healing process restarted <EOS>
<SOS> this approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics biodynamics biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies <EOS>
<SOS> besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> the most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin ii protein c and protein s and activated protein c resistance mutations of factor v <EOS>
<SOS> less frequently dysfibrinogenemia increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor ii may be found <EOS>
<SOS> klinefelter is syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals <EOS>
<SOS> early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members <EOS>
<SOS> epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning <EOS>
<SOS> there is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected <EOS>
<SOS> results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens epiduroscopy and conventional and computed tomographic ct epidurography are sometimes contradictory <EOS>
<SOS> we have performed ct epidurography in approximately <NUM> patients to date <EOS>
<SOS> insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features such as the rail road track phenomenon or the plica mediana dorsalis <EOS>
<SOS> patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied <EOS>
<SOS> catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation <EOS>
<SOS> conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile x ray apparatus usually in the recovery room using <NUM> ml iopamidol solutrast <NUM> m <EOS>
<SOS> selected patients good mental state and stable psychic condition after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee were investigated with ct epidurography using the same contrast medium partly diluted <EOS>
<SOS> from among the ct scans performed until now five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies <EOS>
<SOS> when small volumes 5 ml of iopamidol were injected slowly we regularly observed a railroad track phenomenon in the ap images of conventional epidurographies <EOS>
<SOS> after rapid injection of larger volumes 10 <NUM> ml the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline <EOS>
<SOS> ct epidurography in these cases 5 out of <NUM> patients revealed a plica mediana dorsalis <EOS>
<SOS> in the majority of the ct scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior ventral compartment was unfilled by contrast medium <EOS>
<SOS> according to the findings of several investigators dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal <EOS>
<SOS> in lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium <EOS>
<SOS> in other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths as if these structures together with the connective tissue strands between them formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane <EOS>
<SOS> a railroad track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the x ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space indicating an incorrect catheter position <EOS>
<SOS> according to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by ct scans this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position <EOS>
<SOS> small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space <EOS>
<SOS> this rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the railroad track in ap contrast epidurographies <EOS>
<SOS> ct epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid contrast medium local anaesthetics complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens <EOS>
<SOS> it stands to reason that this time and cost expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies but can help to interpret them properly <EOS>
<SOS> a 71 year old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft x ray therapy total dose <NUM> gy half dose depth <MOB> mm <EOS>
<SOS> 5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed <EOS>
<SOS> this unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens <EOS>
<SOS> in this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy as has been reported on several occasions in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> however this possibility cannot be entirely excluded <EOS>
<SOS> a vascular etiology of parkinson is disease pd has been long debated <EOS>
<SOS> in order to search for an ischemic basis of pd we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of <NUM> pd patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age matched groups of stroke patients and normals <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> 27 subjects with pd who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease <EOS>
<SOS> the frequencies of carotid stenoses ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with pure pd and normals <EOS>
<SOS> only one 1 6 individual with pd presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism <EOS>
<SOS> these findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with pd but seldomly is causally related <EOS>
<SOS> neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging mri in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis <EOS>
<SOS> the mri brain scans of <NUM> patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed along with the clinical information provided in the request form <EOS>
<SOS> all patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement <EOS>
<SOS> cranial facial nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> a wide spectrum of mr findings was noted periventricular and white matter lesions on t2 w spin echo images mimicking multiple sclerosis 46 multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions mimicking metastases 36 solitary intraaxial mass mimicking high grade astrocytoma 9 solitary extraaxial mass mimicking meningioma 5 leptomeningeal enhancement 36 <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis <EOS>
<SOS> mri shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis <EOS>
<SOS> these findings however are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in selected cases with isolated brain involvement meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required <EOS>
<SOS> in 1990 we first described the papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome ppgss <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever <EOS>
<SOS> the skin <NUM> lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days <EOS>
<SOS> in more than half of the patients an acute parvovirus b <NUM> infection has been proven <EOS>
<SOS> in a few cases of ppgss other viral infections have been found for example hepatitis b and measles <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a patient with ppgss and review the literature <EOS>
<SOS> fungus bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe candida albicans infection <EOS>
<SOS> a newborn infant with vacterl association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after candida albicans sepsis and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure <EOS>
<SOS> following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin b and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin b via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly <EOS>
<SOS> discussion since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls <EOS>
<SOS> interactional understanding in psychoanalysis especially the concept of the third point suggests that the development of insight empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding <EOS>
<SOS> in this context the psychoanalytic method here understood as working with resistance transference and countertransference does not only offer a route to cognition but also to the formation of a conflict solving egostrengthening and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> the formula interpretation on the basis of countertransference describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts <EOS>
<SOS> this is exemplified by a case history <EOS>
<SOS> the dutch supreme court ruled that in exceptional instances physician assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness <EOS>
<SOS> a recent report shows that explicit requests for physician assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the netherlands <EOS>
<SOS> some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described <EOS>
<SOS> psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician assisted suicide is relatively rare <EOS>
<SOS> pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease <EOS>
<SOS> two major variants pemphigus vulgaris pv and pemphigus foliaceus pf are distinguished <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the department of dermatology at the university of würzburg over the past <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> post dural puncture headache pdph is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient is age have been proven to be important determinants <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether post operative recumbency can reduce the risk of pdph has not been answered uniformly <EOS>
<SOS> and besides some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures for example as to clear definition and exact documentation of post operative immobilization <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore fine gauge needles 26g or more have not been investigated yet <EOS>
<SOS> the first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of pdph under controlled conditions using thin needles <EOS>
<SOS> secondly we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified atraumatic tip whitacre and atraucan by comparing them to quincke needles of identical diameter <EOS>
<SOS> most of the former investigators compared quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on pdph <EOS>
<SOS> three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion <EOS>
<SOS> background neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system <EOS>
<SOS> the pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain smp <EOS>
<SOS> typical disorders with a smp component are complex regional pain syndromes reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster <EOS>
<SOS> the tendency towards sphincter preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis caa in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> in order to improve functional results creation of a colonic j pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis cpa was proposed <EOS>
<SOS> two different operation techniques exist i double stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line <EOS>
<SOS> a long rectal remnant after double stapling leads to urgency in <NUM> of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant <EOS>
<SOS> no propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis <EOS>
<SOS> therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of <NUM> cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation <EOS>
<SOS> under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2 6 d after caa to 1 3 d after cpa <EOS>
<SOS> this effect is maximal during the first postoperative months but is still significant after <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> colonic pouch construction also leads due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10 0 after caa to 5 4 after cpa <EOS>
<SOS> therefore creation of a colonic j pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter preserving procedure <EOS>
<SOS> background workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co carcinogenic agents <EOS>
<SOS> these latter substances include asbestos tar products metal dust wood dust cement dust and paints <EOS>
<SOS> presently there are no well defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication both essential for quality management in echocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> embolia cutis medicamentosa nicolau syndrom is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area <EOS>
<SOS> intra arterial and or para arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra articular injections into the knee <EOS>
<SOS> in a 30 beds unit of the orthopedic university clinic in bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period <EOS>
<SOS> there have been done <NUM> injections into ileosacral joints as well as <NUM> injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally <NUM> into facett joints of the lumbar spine <EOS>
<SOS> on the other side there have been done <NUM> chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas <EOS>
<SOS> the growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective case control study at the university of frankfurt germany <NUM> babies born to opiate addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> after birth they developed a withdrawal syndrome neonatal abstinence syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards <EOS>
<SOS> the group of opiate exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment n 48 and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program n 51 <EOS>
<SOS> the methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight 2822 g than children in the group without methadone 2471 g <EOS>
<SOS> the abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group convulsions 47 1 than in heroin exposed babies without methadone treatment convulsions 27 1 <EOS>
<SOS> women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate addicted women without methadone substitution <EOS>
<SOS> moreover they cared significantly better for their babies 81 3 of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90 9 cared adequately <EOS>
<SOS> the data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate exposed babies <EOS>
<SOS> neurofibromatosis type <NUM> nf1 is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression <EOS>
<SOS> epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking <EOS>
<SOS> up until now <NUM> patients with nf1 have been treated at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of the university of hamburg <EOS>
<SOS> forty two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site <EOS>
<SOS> surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction frequently combined with face lifting <EOS>
<SOS> in our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo encapsulated facilitating the preparation of the tumour <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected <EOS>

<SOS> a granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 65 year old male patient who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy <EOS>
<SOS> in the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found <EOS>
<SOS> repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded <EOS>
<SOS> after indicating the operative therapy the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach <EOS>
<SOS> the histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus tumor of abrikossoff <EOS>
<SOS> since the tumor grade was unknown our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures <EOS>
<SOS> there has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the case is discussed with a review of the literature <EOS>
<SOS> this review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients <EOS>
<SOS> acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease <EOS>
<SOS> typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated <EOS>
<SOS> the appropriate ancillary tests are presented <EOS>
<SOS> psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years but for severely ill patients often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care the situation remains unsatisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> community based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs <EOS>
<SOS> neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet <EOS>
<SOS> a diagnostic scoring system recently published by ohmann et al <EOS>
<SOS> in this journal was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2 359 patients admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior provisional and senior surgeons final clinical diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> to assess the diagnostic ability of the score the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters <EOS>
<SOS> of 2 359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis <NUM> were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology for a prevalence of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the overall sensitivity specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0 50 0 94 0 77 0 83 and 0 82 0 93 for the score 0 63 0 93 0 77 <NUM> and 0 84 and for the final clinical diagnosis 0 90 0 94 0 85 0 96 and 0 93 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> of the main diagnostic performance parameter the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis p 0 05 <NUM> test <EOS>
<SOS> the score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> with respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis the score demonstrated a superior performance with only <NUM> cases missed 0 9 <EOS>
<SOS> however the number of patients with acute appendicitis including those with perforated disease who were not identified by the score was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis 245 vs 63 <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to the main procedural performance parameter the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator p 0 05 <NUM> test <EOS>
<SOS> the results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available <EOS>
<SOS> it may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of mri are compiled <EOS>
<SOS> resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem <EOS>
<SOS> the microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene eptfe is suitable for tracheal reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization <EOS>
<SOS> in so dours eptfe prostheses were reinforced with ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene phdpe rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs <EOS>
<SOS> one of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect <EOS>
<SOS> results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability <EOS>
<SOS> the reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize <EOS>
<SOS> in vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> the improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects <EOS>
<SOS> primary infection with human herpesviruses <NUM> and <NUM> hhv 6 and hhv 7 during early childhood causes permanent latent infection usually without any ill effects only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum <EOS>
<SOS> like other herpesviruses hhv 6 and hhv 7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective e g <EOS>
<SOS> in transplant recipients aids tumour patients <EOS>
<SOS> hhv 6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hodgkin is disease <EOS>
<SOS> while hhv 7 may be associated with similar disorders more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses <EOS>
<SOS> pulmonary artery catheterization pac is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast it has been suggested that pac might increase mortality <EOS>
<SOS> available data do not allow the definitive omission of pac in medical intensive care nor do they justify its widespread use <EOS>
<SOS> possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about pac <EOS>
<SOS> open questions on the influence of pac on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials <EOS>
<SOS> beforehand knowledge about pac has to be improved <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence pac should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means <EOS>
<SOS> it is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> a long term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives <EOS>
<SOS> both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine <EOS>
<SOS> the exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro and microcirculation of the penis 6 are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery <EOS>
<SOS> adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer 5 are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra <EOS>
<SOS> mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship <EOS>
<SOS> the arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> the dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this article is to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium term outcome in <NUM> patients treated conservatively and <NUM> patients treated surgically by arthroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> the criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging mri which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis <EOS>
<SOS> the stages on mri follow the morphology of the interface i e the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone on t1 and t2 weighted images <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> and <NUM> months there were no substantial differences visible on mri between the two different treatment groups <EOS>
<SOS> in fact in the majority of cases <NUM> 60 the mri result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the mri 36 to 30 nevertheless a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases 4 <EOS>
<SOS> in both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms <EOS>
<SOS> the number of women with congenital cardiac disease who mature into adulthood is increasing <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients <EOS>
<SOS> most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives especially low estrogen combination or progestin only preparations with the exception of those who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications especially in cyanosis pulmonary hypertension eisenmenger reaction rhythm disturbances fluid retention especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure arterial hypertension important in coarctation infectious complications endocarditis or hyperlipidemia <EOS>
<SOS> oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events <EOS>

<SOS> pt ptt platelet count progressively pa d dimer tat and ptf normalised progressively after heparinisation <EOS>
<SOS> however only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw heparin <EOS>
<SOS> d dimer tat and ptf levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with acute or chronic myocarditis arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the potentially malignant tachy and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis <EOS>
<SOS> factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes <EOS>
<SOS> on the one hand inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential <EOS>
<SOS> fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> lastly vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> non invasive rhythmological evaluation by <NUM> h holter ecg measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at risk patient with myocarditis <EOS>
<SOS> programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> it should be emphasized that at the present time optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist <EOS>
<SOS> in a selected patient population immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in the interim further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment vt ablation and aicd implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology <EOS>
<SOS> aim to investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> material and methods autografts 4 mm of the left common carotid artery in <NUM> wistar rats were harvested up to <NUM> weeks after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen ii and iv <EOS>
<SOS> results the demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture <EOS>
<SOS> in the intima the organisation and amount of collagen iv was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments <EOS>
<SOS> the media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break <EOS>
<SOS> the adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis in which collagen ii and iv positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion <EOS>
<SOS> the marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen positive extracellular matrix <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery <EOS>
<SOS> we treated <NUM> patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> 2200 had invasive melanomas with less than <NUM> mm breslow thickness of these <NUM> developed metastases <EOS>
<SOS> three had second primary tumors with greater thickness <EOS>
<SOS> one case showed metastasis from another tumor <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically <EOS>
<SOS> the remaining <NUM> cases showed some peculiarities a greater proportion of late and of internal as contrasted to regional metastases <EOS>
<SOS> most of these primary tumors had a breslow thickness of more than <NUM> mm and were clark level ii or even iv <EOS>
<SOS> male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over represented <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient is and analyst is perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased <EOS>
<SOS> successful interpretation enables the patient to feel enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of primary aggression developed in freud is speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief <EOS>
<SOS> the metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship <EOS>
<SOS> freud is and subsequently eissler is examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind is vulnerability in the face of mortality <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness <EOS>
<SOS> since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor <EOS>
<SOS> sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient is irritation <EOS>
<SOS> interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance interpretation in transference however is viewed as profitable <EOS>
<SOS> finally those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed which compel the analyst to protect the setting <EOS>
<SOS> background respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world <EOS>
<SOS> highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life <EOS>
<SOS> young infants especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd chronic lung disease cld congenital heart disease cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe rsv disease <EOS>
<SOS> specific therapeutic options for rsv are limited <EOS>
<SOS> in this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal epidural technique in trauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> background in denmark france germany great britain and italy the ophtel project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine an institute for medical informatics and health services research a publishing company and different industrial partners in the edp market <EOS>
<SOS> purpose a prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial ct with the long term follow up mri in children with severe head injury <EOS>
<SOS> another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions found only in mri <EOS>
<SOS> a differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis patient information on avoidance of known dangers and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected <EOS>
<SOS> if no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient is condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about this is considered to be a treatment error and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm <EOS>
<SOS> information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time which generally means on the day before the operation <EOS>
<SOS> an exception is made to this rule for day surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind <EOS>
<SOS> such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information and making decisions <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of unconscious patients everything depends on presumable consent to the operation <EOS>
<SOS> if a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information <EOS>
<SOS> within the last few years the use of point of care analyzers increased <EOS>
<SOS> these testing is primarily performed in the emergency room intensive care units and in the operating room using small portable analyzers <EOS>
<SOS> the fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting <EOS>
<SOS> patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving blood and insensible losses <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a <NUM> year old patient is reported who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum ck and ckmb values of <NUM> and <NUM> u l respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the patient underwent bicycle exercise testing <NUM> days after a myocardial infarction in <NUM> w steps every <NUM> min starting with <NUM> w the ergometry was interrupted at <NUM> w because of st segment depression of <NUM> mv in v6 <EOS>
<SOS> systolic blood pressure dropped to <NUM> mm hg combined with severe angina and shock <EOS>
<SOS> volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> immediate m mode and doppler echo revealed a stiletto shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency <EOS>
<SOS> the transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture <EOS>
<SOS> despite of shock mitral valve replacement was performed successfully <EOS>
<SOS> to our knowledge this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> the flow directed balloon tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by swann and ganz <NUM> has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units <EOS>
<SOS> the rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding <NUM> percent <EOS>
<SOS> main symptoms are cough hemoptysis dyspnea and cardiac shock <EOS>
<SOS> complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon tipped catheters are not strictly followed excessive catheter manipulation advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk <EOS>
<SOS> on <NUM> patients with <NUM> unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may <NUM> and april 1998 in <NUM> patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base <EOS>
<SOS> after partial corporectomy and discectomy a tricortical bone graft has been inserted <EOS>
<SOS> an additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system <EOS>
<SOS> the incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler <EOS>
<SOS> controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by x ray and ct scan <EOS>
<SOS> there was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection <EOS>
<SOS> splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures <EOS>
<SOS> this is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic <EOS>
<SOS> this series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding <EOS>
<SOS> mean age of <NUM> patients was <NUM> years median <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> 25 of patients had an initial barthel index of 30 20 presented with tia is and prind is <EOS>
<SOS> 9 suffered from cerebral hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> the unbroken chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care 9 4 days without prolonging the rehabilitation phase <EOS>
<SOS> the one month mortality was 6 7 one year mortality 18 3 <EOS>
<SOS> discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5 4 <EOS>
<SOS> overall more than 90 of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic <EOS>
<SOS> combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually <EOS>
<SOS> this is a routine procedure for the instrument staff <EOS>
<SOS> practice has shown however that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments implants operating room staff and surgical planning causes problems <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of this a prophylactic search for sources of error began risk management <EOS>
<SOS> if the sources of error are found described and remedied knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team <EOS>
<SOS> cooperation and communication among manufacturer surgeon and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks <EOS>
<SOS> the obligate intracellular bacterium chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques <EOS>
<SOS> chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection <EOS>
<SOS> atherosclerosis however is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall <EOS>
<SOS> a bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously <EOS>
<SOS> the study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy <EOS>
<SOS> besides medical and sociodemographic data two personality factors self efficacy and locus of control were found to predict postoperative pain <EOS>
<SOS> self efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes <EOS>
<SOS> locus of control in the extreme case is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action versus an external orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate <EOS>
<SOS> we postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them <EOS>
<SOS> at present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility <EOS>
<SOS> one reason is the individuality of the host especially with regard to the inflammatory response <EOS>
<SOS> inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen impregnated polyester prosthesis dacron in balb c mice on experimental days 1 18 38 and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target <EOS>
<SOS> specific polymer antibodies enhanced by repeated implantations could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> these antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating <EOS>
<SOS> the antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete freund is adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> results suggest that specific polymer antibodies reflecting an inflammatory response might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> twenty nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the trauma center bergmannsheil university of bochum germany between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> all patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> lateral condylar fractures <NUM> medial condylar fractures and <NUM> tangential posterior hoffa type fractures <EOS>
<SOS> twenty eight closed injuries and <NUM> grade iib open fracture were included <EOS>
<SOS> eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton <EOS>
<SOS> all fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within <NUM> h of admission <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight bearing for 6 8 weeks progressing to full weight bearing <EOS>
<SOS> the mean follow up was <NUM> months <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic outcome clinical result radiographs was rated by the neer score <EOS>
<SOS> twenty seven patients were available for follow up examination <EOS>
<SOS> of these <NUM> were rated as excellent <EOS>
<SOS> 3 achieved satisfactory results and <NUM> had an unsatisfactory result <EOS>
<SOS> all patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries <EOS>
<SOS> open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long term results <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton <EOS>
<SOS> the realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients <EOS>
<SOS> the global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the who guidelines for palliative medicine <EOS>
<SOS> in light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group palliative psycho oncology must offer patient centered holistic care in which the psycho oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians nurses religious workers psychologists ergotherpists physiotherapists social workers and especially family members <EOS>
<SOS> together this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed <EOS>
<SOS> budd chiari syndrome bcs with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> patients who received <NUM> liver grafts and were followed up for at least <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> one patient died after <NUM> months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia another patient died after <NUM> years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> the actuarial 5 year survival rate is <NUM> compared to <NUM> in all other <NUM> orthotopic liver transplantations performed from september <NUM> to december <NUM> at our institution <EOS>
<SOS> anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin <EOS>
<SOS> three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis one patient for <NUM> week only early after the transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy <EOS>
<SOS> two patients had to be retransplanted one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to gi bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake <EOS>
<SOS> terminal bcs represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation however life long closely monitored anticoagulation is essential <EOS>
<SOS> postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture <EOS>
<SOS> optimal doses are <NUM> mg oral estradiol <NUM> mg conjugated equine estrogens <NUM> mg estrone and <NUM> µg transdermal estradiol <EOS>
<SOS> there is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non optimal dietary intake of calcium <EOS>
<SOS> observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later <EOS>
<SOS> it is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis with a diagnosis based on who criteria <EOS>
<SOS> raloxifene a selective estrogen receptor modulator and tibolone a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic progestogenic and androgenic properties may constitute alternatives to estrogen replacement therapy <EOS>
<SOS> raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some <NUM> in women with prevalent osteoporosis <EOS>
<SOS> artificial insemination from donor heterologous insemination is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility <EOS>
<SOS> in this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized <EOS>
<SOS> although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not identifiable information on biological and social characteristics <EOS>
<SOS> semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population <EOS>
<SOS> the decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples <EOS>
<SOS> retrospectively however the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership <EOS>
<SOS> the most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children <EOS>
<SOS> the course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation <EOS>
<SOS> they receive more love and care than usual children <EOS>
<SOS> their rights concerning the insemination however are poorly considered <EOS>
<SOS> if we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights non disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems <EOS>
<SOS> the extended field of view imaging procedure named siescape provides for the first time a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to <NUM> cm in length <EOS>
<SOS> this allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view without having to assemble several pictures <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore pathological find ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings <EOS>
<SOS> this method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding for instance a tumor during therapy <EOS>
<SOS> heart rate variability hrv has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction <EOS>
<SOS> recently analysis of hrv particularly of the standard deviation of nn intervals sdnn from short term ecg recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from <NUM> hour holter monitorings <EOS>
<SOS> the present study is the first to compare sdnn from short term recordings to that from <NUM> hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients at the time of discharge from the hospital sdnn from holter monitoring averaged <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ms compared to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> determined from short term recordings <EOS>
<SOS> patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age left ventricular ejection fraction mean rr interval from holter recording <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ms mean rr from short term recording 783 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ms and sdnn from the holter recording 71 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ms p 0 001 however patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of sdnn measured from short term ecg registrations 35 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ms p ns <EOS>
<SOS> thus sdnn measured from short term ecg recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of hrv should be performed using <NUM> hour holter monitoring which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone <EOS>
<SOS> glomus tumors glomangiomata are benign tumors arising from glomus cells <EOS>
<SOS> multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant which is usually located subungually <EOS>
<SOS> nonetheless multiple glomangiomata sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature may cause considerable discomfort <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors <EOS>
<SOS> sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we report on sclerotherapy in a <NUM> year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors <EOS>
<SOS> conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass lvm are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning <EOS>
<SOS> three dimensional 3d echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of lvm <EOS>
<SOS> this study was performed to compare lvm measurement by one 1d two 2d and 3d echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging mri in patients pts with dilated cardiomyopathy dcm <EOS>
<SOS> determination of functional residual capacity frc can be performed through washout methods indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography <EOS>
<SOS> some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated <EOS>
<SOS> however most measurement setups are bulky cumbersome to use and their running costs are high <EOS>
<SOS> hence frc measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated <NUM> patients such as the determination of best peep the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> up to now most efforts to improve and simplify frc measurement were made at the expense of accuracy <EOS>
<SOS> an ideal method ought to be accurate easy to handle and cost effective <EOS>
<SOS> it should supply not only frc data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space <EOS>
<SOS> these demands can be met using modern data acquisition software <EOS>
<SOS> the pros and cons of all methods available for frc measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients <EOS>
<SOS> a conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination <NUM> of the parameters mentioned above <EOS>
<SOS> the measurement error can be lowered under 5 by special corrections for flow and <NUM> nitrogen signal delay and rise times changes of gas viscosity <EOS>
<SOS> for flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used <EOS>
<SOS> using a laptop computer for data <NUM> acquisition the bed side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care <EOS>
<SOS> it is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as alveolar mixing efficiency and lung clearance index <EOS>
<SOS> three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly securing the material needs of those requiring care creating appropriate care structures and providing an effective counselling back up to alleviate interface problems <EOS>
<SOS> thouse latter process oriented aids have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade <EOS>
<SOS> the aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care to stop the revolving door syndrome to ensure that older people can stay in their homes to support family members acting as care providers to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers <EOS>
<SOS> in the context of case managment these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions the gatekeeper broker and advocacy functions <EOS>
<SOS> each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting care management community care managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help <EOS>
<SOS> bullous pemphigoid bp is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin <EOS>
<SOS> several clinical variants of bp have been described and we now add our observations of two bp cases mimicking subacute prurigo <EOS>
<SOS> both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation <EOS>
<SOS> blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up <EOS>
<SOS> histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> in the serum of both patients indirect immunofluorescence on nacl separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters <EOS>
<SOS> perilesional skin biopsies showed linear igg or c3 deposits in the basement membran zone <EOS>
<SOS> immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230 kd protein which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen <EOS>
<SOS> these cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid <EOS>
<SOS> the distal metatarsal osteotomy according to magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation <EOS>
<SOS> the length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy <EOS>
<SOS> if necessary soft tissue release and or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal <EOS>
<SOS> a review of <NUM> foot operations in <NUM> patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head <EOS>
<SOS> evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation the results were less satisfying <EOS>
<SOS> the metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by <NUM> <NUM> ° and the intermetatarsal angles by <NUM> <NUM> ° on average <EOS>
<SOS> the sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the contribution of rudolf virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten or present day dermatologists are not aware of it <EOS>
<SOS> the present historical review is intended to show that virchow is thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive <EOS>
<SOS> the report encompasses a short biography including virchow is nonmedical activities <EOS>
<SOS> it starts with early experimental publications which laid to the foundation for his fame and with dermatological studies of his early period <EOS>
<SOS> this is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work cellularpathologie <EOS>
<SOS> special mention is made of virchow is lasting contributions to medical and particularly dermatological terminology <EOS>
<SOS> finally his historical studies his latter small publications on topics in dermatology his pupils and scientific friends and the social political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> thus a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways <EOS>
<SOS> starter is pistols are often bought for self defense but can also be used for criminal activities e g <EOS>
<SOS> assaults etc <EOS>
<SOS> when a starter is pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired a powerful shooting noise results <EOS>
<SOS> the level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma <EOS>
<SOS> for legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise <EOS>
<SOS> we examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions <EOS>
<SOS> in all <NUM> different models of starter is pistols of <NUM> different calibres were examined <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to blank cartridges <NUM> mm tear gas cartridges were also examined <EOS>
<SOS> four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle <NUM> ° shooting direction <NUM> ° <NUM> ° and <NUM> ° towards the firer <EOS>

<SOS> at a distance of <NUM> m and in the <NUM> ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded <NUM> db <EOS>
<SOS> at a shooting distance of <NUM> cm the peak sound pressure levels reached <NUM> db <EOS>
<SOS> in addition we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer <EOS>
<SOS> owing to their rare incidence foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in <NUM> the literature by means of case reports <EOS>
<SOS> here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> in seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved <EOS>
<SOS> except for one case the foreign material could be removed completely <EOS>
<SOS> three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow up period but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases <EOS>
<SOS> before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident however we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits preferably by means of photography <EOS>
<SOS> ct is the method of choice for localising the foreign body except for the depiction of wood particles <EOS>
<SOS> here sonography and mr should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> as the therapeutic approach the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists neuro and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid inflammation the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions post operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided <EOS>
<SOS> treatment is completed by high dose antibiotics using csf soluble substances and if necessary anti convulsives <EOS>
<SOS> rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery <EOS>
<SOS> these operations which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to share the patient is airway require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods in order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis lasik we designed a prospective study including <NUM> eyes <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation af is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects beta blockers calcium channel antagonists may depress ventricular contractility and or decrease arterial blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> we have identified <NUM> intravascular sites in the superior svc and inferior vena cava ivc where parasympathetic nerves which innervate the atrioventricular node can be stimulated electrically <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> dogs a 7 f catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non fluoroscopically positioned in the svc and in the proximal ivc time for positioning 3 5 minutes <EOS>
<SOS> high frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation ps with <NUM> hz at an impulse duration of <NUM> ms was performed during pacing induced af <EOS>
<SOS> results with increasing stimulus strength a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during ps in the svc and ivc p0 01 anova <EOS>
<SOS> the negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of ps and ceased immediately after termination of ps <EOS>
<SOS> during ventricular pacing at a constant rate no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during ps <EOS>
<SOS> ps in the ivc yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the svc <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during af can easily be achieved in the svc and ivc in dogs <EOS>
<SOS> this procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of ps in humans <EOS>
<SOS> if the results translate to patients ps may be very beneficial in the treatment of af in patients with congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of <NUM> months <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> of these patients <NUM> were treated operatively and <NUM> conservatively <EOS>
<SOS> according to the ao asif classification 66 of the operated group were fractures of type a 29 of type b and 5 of type c all patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and apart from six patients with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting <EOS>
<SOS> the conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of böhler with closed reduction plaster cast and rehabilitation program <EOS>
<SOS> all fractures in the conservative group were of type a <EOS>
<SOS> charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage <NUM> of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy hmsn which is known as charcot marie tooth disease since <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this entity which can be subdivided into <NUM> groups including subgroups predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly <EOS>
<SOS> the first symptom often unnoticed by the patient for a long period is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer toe formation and mobile pes cavus <EOS>
<SOS> progredient atrophy of the peroneal extensor tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment <EOS>
<SOS> permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma stage <NUM> of hmsn <EOS>
<SOS> the alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells <EOS>
<SOS> the first description based on six cases was published in <NUM> by yousem and hochholzer <EOS>
<SOS> from their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type ii pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein b and c of human surfactant <EOS>
<SOS> both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar like spaces were stained <EOS>
<SOS> the septal connection tissue cells did not react <EOS>
<SOS> these findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and hence the differentiation into type ii pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma <EOS>
<SOS> breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women whereas it is rare in men <EOS>
<SOS> in our own case series the ratio is <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of <NUM> de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from <NUM> to <NUM> and a comparative discussion of <NUM> female breast cancers from the same geographic area <EOS>
<SOS> we should like to focus on the following observations <EOS>
<SOS> patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia <EOS>
<SOS> an overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder called midas syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> it is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome x with consecutive monosomy xp22 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the rapid development of recombinant dna technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities termed gene therapy <EOS>
<SOS> gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes correct defective genes or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor bearing host <EOS>
<SOS> currently an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> despite substantial progress a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient <EOS>
<SOS> since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> this report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation <EOS>
<SOS> special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment <EOS>
<SOS> using the ptb simulator which emits real signals from patients we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the dinamap <NUM> critikon and the hp m 1008b hewlett packard <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of <NUM> patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator <EOS>
<SOS> the invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation <EOS>
<SOS> the invasive system showed a cut off frequency of <NUM> hz the damping constant was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> with <NUM> record signals from patients we carried out <NUM> simulated measurements each <EOS>
<SOS> from a total of <NUM> bio signals from patients the dinamap <NUM> was able to process <NUM> signals and the hp m 1008b <NUM> signals <EOS>
<SOS> the mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to 2 50 mmhg <NUM> mmhg p0 05 and <NUM> mmhg with the dinamap <NUM> and to 8 5 mmhg p0 001 5 15 mmhg p0 001 and 5 58 mmhg p0 001 for the hp m 1008b <EOS>
<SOS> the 95 confidence limit for the systolic diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to <NUM> mmhg <NUM> mmhg and <NUM> mmhg for the dinamap <NUM> and <NUM> mmhg <NUM> mmhg and <NUM> mmhg for the hp m 1008b <EOS>
<SOS> the differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the performance tests we achieved with the ptb simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations <EOS>
<SOS> the american association for the advanecement of medical instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of <NUM> <NUM> mmhg <EOS>
<SOS> none of the examined instruments lay within these limits <EOS>
<SOS> due to the systematic and stochastic errors we think that the dinamap <NUM> critikon and the hp m 1008b hewlett packard do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations <EOS>
<SOS> however emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry <EOS>
<SOS> therefore psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services <EOS>
<SOS> our present contribution aims at improving this situation <EOS>
<SOS> it gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned their symptomatology and psychopathology and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations <EOS>
<SOS> 3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined type i means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury type ii is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion typ ii stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma <EOS>
<SOS> overlapping of different types occurs <EOS>
<SOS> type i the incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2 5 <EOS>
<SOS> multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior <EOS>
<SOS> with a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined <EOS>
<SOS> typ ii the leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> a ct scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at <EOS>
<SOS> during the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated <EOS>
<SOS> abdominal injuries are to be found in 3 4 of all spinal injuries <EOS>
<SOS> all organs could be affected <EOS>
<SOS> a typical constallation is the seat belt syndrome with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine <EOS>
<SOS> the main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially <EOS>
<SOS> most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis of this combination is favorable <EOS>
<SOS> typ ii in 17 18 of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> from these only one third need surgical care <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6 2 were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above <EOS>
<SOS> the risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase day 1 surgery <EOS>
<SOS> additional injuries potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach <EOS>
<SOS> non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures <EOS>
<SOS> in the early phase of treatment on the c spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied <EOS>
<SOS> experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation <EOS>
<SOS> two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here <EOS>
<SOS> the first case report clearly shows the life saving and injury reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at <NUM> km h <EOS>
<SOS> in the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially <EOS>
<SOS> hemodynamic instability occurred after <NUM> h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the presented cases shows that besides the well known benefits there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags <EOS>
<SOS> these have not been described before <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time even though they are initially stable as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag associated injuries with conventional methods <EOS>
<SOS> a questionnaire with <NUM> questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis as sufferers in germany was distributed to a representative <NUM> out of the more than <NUM> patient members of the german as society <NUM> patients 54 responded <EOS>
<SOS> the age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the german population <EOS>
<SOS> the group of patients more than <NUM> years old is however under represented <EOS>
<SOS> introduction headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem <EOS>
<SOS> the noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown <EOS>
<SOS> a preparation was developed in the barbiturate anesthetized rat in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed <EOS>
<SOS> atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> there are probably several candidate genes that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years a growing number of gene polymorphisms associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction has been identified <EOS>
<SOS> these genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism regulation of blood pressure and clotting <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms e g <EOS>
<SOS> familial hypercholesterolemia genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent <EOS>
<SOS> due to their frequency there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders <EOS>
<SOS> fourty nine patients with <NUM> complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from august <NUM> to february <NUM> in a prospectively documented study <EOS>
<SOS> the fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach maryland approach <EOS>
<SOS> thirty seven patients were polytraumatized with an iss of <NUM> pts <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the iss was <NUM> pts <EOS>
<SOS> good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff k <NUM> mm could be achieved in <NUM> fracturers 96 <EOS>
<SOS> thirty six patients with <NUM> fractures could be evaluated after <NUM> months on average <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> fractures 76 the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d aubigne and harris scores <EOS>
<SOS> radiological results were excellent in <NUM> fractures 57 and satisfactory in <NUM> fractures heeg score <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases 14 a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically <EOS>
<SOS> no wound infections however were observed <EOS>
<SOS> further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in <NUM> cases 11 relevant heterotopic ossifications brooker ii iv in <NUM> cases 14 and aseptic femoral head necrosis in <NUM> cases 5 <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases a total hip replacement thr for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed <EOS>
<SOS> two more cases are scheduled for thr due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> a good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach maryland in complex fractures of the acetabulum <EOS>
<SOS> however the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome <EOS>
<SOS> in complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved <EOS>
<SOS> the discussion on the results of open spinal surgery in particular on complications as a result of open surgery e g the so called post discotomy syndrome has led to the development of less invasive methods especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses <EOS>
<SOS> percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods such as discography retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis <EOS>
<SOS> since the <NUM> s various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy automated percutaneous nucleotomy intradiscal laser procedures and in part endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical results vary from <NUM> good very good results to almost <NUM> good very good results depending on the author and study <EOS>
<SOS> it is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted <EOS>
<SOS> the results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method which often have large case numbers but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design <EOS>
<SOS> to attain good results percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria <EOS>
<SOS> at the present time it can be concluded that in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old patient with hepatitis virus c hcv infection had a secondary polyclonal igg igm cryoglobulinemia with a benign <NUM> year course <EOS>
<SOS> clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura pp <EOS>
<SOS> histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis <EOS>
<SOS> food containing tartrazine trig gered flares of the pp as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing <EOS>
<SOS> in most of the previously described cases of hcv and type ii cryoglobulinemia the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis <EOS>
<SOS> normal aging is associated with changes in body composition thirst perception renal function and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> these disorders which include dehydration hypernatremia hyponatremia urinary frequency and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance <EOS>
<SOS> although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this overview is to evaluate established diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in germany <EOS>
<SOS> for compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven <EOS>
<SOS> for differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> the causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed <EOS>
<SOS> in this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent duration of exposure individual aspects of non occupational influences time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped <EOS>
<SOS> additionally adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine <EOS>
<SOS> spondylosis deformans osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images <EOS>
<SOS> whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> special projections anteroposterior oblique radiographs lateral radiographs in flexion and extension may be the next step <EOS>
<SOS> for many abnormalities mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon mr imaging has become the standard procedure largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution <EOS>
<SOS> ct can be used instead of mr imaging if the latter method is not available and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for mr imaging or ct myelograms and myelo ct can no longer be considered routine imaging methods <EOS>
<SOS> a number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages <EOS>
<SOS> true derotation of the apex even in the thoracic spine is achieved <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system <EOS>
<SOS> the intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube <EOS>
<SOS> beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines <EOS>
<SOS> however the patient is exposed to static as well as to time dependent magnetic fields and radio frequency electromagnetic fields <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the strahlenschutzkommission the german radiological protection commission passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics <EOS>
<SOS> in this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given <EOS>
<SOS> in the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields the gradient fields and the radio frequency fields <EOS>
<SOS> additionally advice is given for the protection of high risk patients personnel and the general public together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers <EOS>
<SOS> six patients with granuloma faciale including patients with multiple lesions were treated successfully with cryosurgery <EOS>
<SOS> granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat <EOS>
<SOS> cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin <EOS>
<SOS> it should be considered as an alternative to dapsone <EOS>
<SOS> the results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of ao osteosynthesis in a group n 32 of the injuried were compared with b group n 187 of injuried treated definitely with external fixator <EOS>
<SOS> there were statistical evaluations and x ray observations of healing in both groups as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as pintract infection osteitis pseudoarthrosis and reoperation <EOS>
<SOS> statistically less significant appearance of complications in a group during 2th and 6th month p 0 001 was observed <EOS>
<SOS> in 12th month of observation these differences statistically disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> healing observed by x ray in 2th 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups <EOS>
<SOS> since 1993 <NUM> patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients 40 concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> according to geissler we found grade i tear in one patient grade ii in three grade ii in six and grade iv in two patients <EOS>
<SOS> the eight individuals with grade ii and iv lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> therefore operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis <EOS>
<SOS> seven patients out of this group 87 5 were followed up clinically and radiologically <NUM> years postoperatively on average <EOS>
<SOS> clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability <EOS>
<SOS> objective grip strength was measured using a jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist <EOS>
<SOS> radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation <EOS>
<SOS> data were evaluated by the jakim and cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by gartland and werley as modified by sarmiento et al <EOS>
<SOS> according to gartland 100 of our patients showed an excellent result these rates were 86 using the jakim score and 60 using the cooney scoring system <EOS>
<SOS> according to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result <EOS>
<SOS> open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard <EOS>
<SOS> but arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization <EOS>
<SOS> this prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with doppler sonography was accepted by the medical council of the bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death <EOS>
<SOS> a survey was undertaken to determine how frequently doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> questionnaires were sent out to all neurological 272 and neurosurgical 128 departments in germany <EOS>
<SOS> in all <NUM> questionnaires were returned <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> departments doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death mostly combined with other methods <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative <EOS>
<SOS> the background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls <EOS>
<SOS> in order to indicate pitfalls the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites <EOS>
<SOS> in none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data <EOS>
<SOS> doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 64 year old man who died within <NUM> h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase negative staphylococci induced left sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve <EOS>
<SOS> infective endocarditis by coagulase negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event <EOS>
<SOS> the macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed <EOS>
<SOS> thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date <EOS>
<SOS> laserotoscopes are suitable for low pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion ome under topical anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than <NUM> mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of <NUM> malignant melanomas and <NUM> junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for <NUM> characteristics <EOS>
<SOS> the following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions digitated radial streaming greyish blue reticular patterns opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas brown black dots on a blue greyish background pseudopodia at the periphery and blue in pink areas <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> therefore diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours <EOS>
<SOS> the present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables including anxiety depression locus of control expectations of pain intensity and social support and postoperative pain analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> clinical experience of <NUM> patients with charge association is reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> the study comprised six girls and five boys <EOS>
<SOS> all presented with congenital heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> eight had bilateral choanal atresia <EOS>
<SOS> coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children <EOS>
<SOS> nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to major abnormalities further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> all children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia <EOS>
<SOS> three patients had cleft lip and palate <EOS>
<SOS> both micrognathia and high arched palate were present in two patients <EOS>
<SOS> facial palsy was observed in six patients <EOS>
<SOS> optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible <EOS>
<SOS> in our experience the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal <EOS>
<SOS> it gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair <EOS>
<SOS> after the child has grown stronger a long term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training <EOS>
<SOS> thrilling are especially those situations when people have to make ethical decisions <EOS>
<SOS> issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed comedies westerns love stories and gangster movies <EOS>
<SOS> enacting these conflicts means offering a solution and in doing so films refer to moral values and at the same time function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics <EOS>
<SOS> but it is possible that ethical principles of good decision making fall victims to the drama of the story <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences <EOS>
<SOS> several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment <EOS>
<SOS> possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed <EOS>
<SOS> inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation <EOS>
<SOS> at present the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time e g by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps <EOS>
<SOS> technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging mri and high resolution sonography us have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> for mri improvements in surface coils dedicated low field systems 0 2 t and software improvements shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques must be mentioned <EOS>
<SOS> for sonography the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies 7 15 mhz and power doppler imaging <EOS>
<SOS> clinical evaluations have shown that mri and us are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases investigating vascularization and quantifying pannus formation <EOS>
<SOS> in order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of mri and us in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism amylase splenic and hepatic dextranase colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues especially in the reticuloendothelial system res <EOS>
<SOS> this tissue storage is limited in time weeks to months is influenced by the employed solution and other factors lysosomes and has usually no clinical importance no res blockade <EOS>
<SOS> we report here a case study of a patient with sepsis lung liver and kidney failure who had an overload of the res with colloids while being treated with dextran molecular weight <NUM> and <NUM> daltons and hydroxyethyl starch mw <MOB> daltons molar substitution 0 7 <EOS>
<SOS> in the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome tss became epidemic among young menstruating women <EOS>
<SOS> a strong correlation was found between tss and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons <EOS>
<SOS> exotoxin producing staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of tss in controlled clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of tss are differentiated <EOS>
<SOS> the nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate <EOS>
<SOS> several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual tss is approximately 1 3 cases per <NUM> <NUM> persons <EOS>
<SOS> the leading symptoms are fever hypotension mucous membrane hyperemia diffuse rashes myalgias vomiting and diarrhea <EOS>
<SOS> the severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> the streptococcal tss stss caused by group a streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal tss <EOS>
<SOS> both staphylococcus aureus and streptococci produce the exotoxin tsst 1 <EOS>
<SOS> new methods allow the detection of tsst 1 production <EOS>
<SOS> however due to the low incidence of tss this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> this report focusses on the emergence and spread of s aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance <EOS>
<SOS> results from typing mrsa originating from different clinical sources in all germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the meca gene to clonal groups of s aureus which have been until now sensitive <EOS>
<SOS> these newly emerging mrsa are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> this results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated mrsa <EOS>
<SOS> worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by s aureus possessing secc and not tst <EOS>
<SOS> background for cataract surgery in this country retro and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method <EOS>
<SOS> it totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain <EOS>
<SOS> especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications but the potential risks can be severe <EOS>
<SOS> in the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect <EOS>
<SOS> a modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with coronary artery disease it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia <EOS>
<SOS> the immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of an <NUM> year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies and clinical signs of rigid spine syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> during treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during rem sleep hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found <EOS>
<SOS> this complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features like pulmonary hypertension daytime sleepiness growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown <EOS>
<SOS> aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall imh <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the literature revealed <NUM> cases of in vivo diagnosed imh reflecting 17 of all dissections whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4 13 <EOS>
<SOS> transesophageal echocardiography computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging and aortography to rule out dissection have been applied for diagnosing imh in 57 49 <NUM> and 38 of the cases respectively <EOS>
<SOS> however diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date <EOS>
<SOS> in 34 imh involves the ascending aorta type a <EOS>
<SOS> the average age of patients with imh ranges between <NUM> and <NUM> years 65 are males <EOS>
<SOS> in 12 imh was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> with 87 arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for imh irrespective of its location <EOS>
<SOS> as suggested by the term mediastinal apoplexy imh may similar to cerebral apoplexy result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media <EOS>
<SOS> with 97 the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection <EOS>
<SOS> mediastinal widening is found in 83 signs of hemothorax pleural effusion are present in 38 acute aortic regurgitation in 26 pericardial effusion in 23 acute neurologic deficits in 12 and pulse deficits in 5 <EOS>
<SOS> in 18 imh progresses to dissection and in another 15 to rupture <EOS>
<SOS> in 25 and 28 respectively dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12 and 9 respectively in the descending thoracic aorta <EOS>
<SOS> the 30 day mortality of imh is 24 36 with type a and 12 with type b imh p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> with surgical repair mortality of type a imh is lowered to 18 compared to 60 with medical treatment p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast with 8 mortality associated with medical treatment prognosis of type b imh is more favorable without surgical intervention the latter associated with a 30 day mortality of 33 p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> thus imh is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type a imh and with medical treatment in type b imh <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele <EOS>
<SOS> our case reports are in accordance to previous publications they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable x ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult <EOS>
<SOS> fractures often occur without pain or trauma <EOS>
<SOS> background since the end of the 1960ies accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to traffic related accidents in older children and adolescents which were consequently registered and documented no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in germany <EOS>
<SOS> this report presents data on accident related hospitalizations in a cohort of <NUM> infants who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in germany from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> one hundred thirty patients underwent <NUM> electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and <NUM> atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis <EOS>
<SOS> the indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation syncope or presyncope intracardiac conduction disturbance and bradyarrhythmia <EOS>
<SOS> in one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study <EOS>
<SOS> atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing <NUM> patients were believed not to require any treatment <NUM> patients received new drug therapy <NUM> patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session <NUM> patients had either a pacemaker or an icd implanted and <NUM> patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested <EOS>
<SOS> atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in <NUM> patients 69 <EOS>
<SOS> except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> after the procedure patients were monitored for <NUM> min in case of overdrive stimulation and for approximately <NUM> h after electrophysiological study or <NUM> h if additional coronary angiography had been performed <EOS>
<SOS> severe complications were not observed <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae <EOS>
<SOS> outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients <EOS>
<SOS> endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects <EOS>
<SOS> a retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long term results <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> implants were inserted <NUM> implants in the periorbital <NUM> implants in the mastoid and six implants in the paranasal region <NUM> implants were short craniofacial brånemark implants and <NUM> implants were dental implants <EOS>
<SOS> the success rate for implant survival was 94 5 <EOS>
<SOS> long term results were promising and more than satisfactory leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants <EOS>
<SOS> the term ecstasy includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity stimulation and the so called entactogenic effects <EOS>
<SOS> entactogen is usually translated as producing a touching within or creating an internal contact and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances <EOS>
<SOS> entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences <EOS>
<SOS> the entactogenic effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3 4 methylenedioxyamphetamine mdma <EOS>
<SOS> mdma induces euphoria and acts stimulating but the most common effect of mdma is a heightened sense of closeness with other people <EOS>
<SOS> the negative effects especially depression and a general sense of anxiety may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy <EOS>
<SOS> ecstasy is not a novel substance <EOS>
<SOS> however the rapid spread connected with the arising techno scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy use world wide is unprecedented <EOS>
<SOS> cisatracurium one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium is an intermediate long acting non depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent <EOS>
<SOS> cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients <EOS>
<SOS> after approval by our institutional review board <NUM> patients asa i ii were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xed95 or 5xed95 of cisatracurium or 3xed90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus <EOS>
<SOS> after oral premedication with <NUM> mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental 4 12 mg kg and maintained with o2 n2o and isoflurane 1 5 2 <EOS>
<SOS> six minutes after administration of thiopental patients received the muscle relaxant <EOS>
<SOS> six minutes later <MOB> mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated <EOS>
<SOS> heart rate hr and blood pressure bp were monitored every minute <EOS>
<SOS> changes of heart rate or blood pressure 20 compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant <EOS>
<SOS> after application of the study drug median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable <EOS>
<SOS> for each muscle relaxant there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes <EOS>
<SOS> after 3xed95 cisatracurium <NUM> of <NUM> patients exhibited haemodynamic changes 20 2 exhibited hypotension and <NUM> tachycardia while in the high dose cisatracurium group <NUM> of <NUM> patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant <EOS>
<SOS> in the vecuronium group <NUM> of <NUM> patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and <NUM> patient had statistically significant tachycardia <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose dependent <EOS>
<SOS> after the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses 3xed95 and 5xed95 or vecuronium 3xed90 only minor cardiovascular changes were observed <EOS>
<SOS> both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients asa i ii <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to its cardiovascular effects cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant <EOS>
<SOS> between june <NUM> and september 1995 <NUM> distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> type a fractures and <NUM> type c fractures ao classification <EOS>
<SOS> the operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch <EOS>
<SOS> follow up was available on all patients and averaged <NUM> months range 6 32 months <EOS>
<SOS> all fractures healed with an average time to union of <NUM> weeks range 8 16 weeks <EOS>
<SOS> bone grafting was not necessary in any case <EOS>
<SOS> sixteen patients achieved almost the same rom as they had had before the injury <EOS>
<SOS> one patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy <NUM> months post trauma <EOS>
<SOS> there were no infections or nonunions <EOS>
<SOS> the retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia and supracondylar femoral fractures <EOS>
<SOS> autolyzed antigen extracted allogenic aa bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix <EOS>
<SOS> it has been clinically applied for years <EOS>
<SOS> in an experimental study in rabbits we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with aa bone <EOS>
<SOS> two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits <EOS>
<SOS> a cell excluding ptfe membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum <EOS>
<SOS> the posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane <EOS>
<SOS> thus two compartments were created selectively preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants <EOS>
<SOS> for each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative ct pqct scans <EOS>
<SOS> implantation of aa bone led to new bone formation in both compartments <EOS>
<SOS> contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume <EOS>
<SOS> although bone formation showed interindividual variations the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the student is t test for paired samples p <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized <EOS>
<SOS> in osseous augmentations with aa bone the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant <EOS>
<SOS> shielding from the periosteum e g by cell excluding membranes leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of aa bone and should therefore be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in europe <EOS>
<SOS> reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern ct scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes <EOS>
<SOS> the lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low dose ct owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma <EOS>
<SOS> undernutrition particularly protein undernutrition contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> the igf i system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications <EOS>
<SOS> in the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin d supplies protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal raises igf i levels improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture <EOS>
<SOS> this nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital <EOS>
<SOS> this underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures <EOS>
<SOS> the article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised <EOS>
<SOS> the chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law <EOS>
<SOS> with the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects <EOS>
<SOS> simultaneously it gains normative significance <EOS>
<SOS> this is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly <EOS>
<SOS> precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly <EOS>
<SOS> a comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens p53 pcna ki67 dna flow cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from <NUM> cases of laryngeal cancers <EOS>
<SOS> clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority t3 43 t4 18 <EOS>
<SOS> a 5 grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei <EOS>
<SOS> positive staining was obtained in 70 for p53 57 for ki67 and 80 for pcna <EOS>
<SOS> sixty two percent of the cases were dna diploid and 38 dna aneuploid <EOS>
<SOS> the dna diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei <EOS>
<SOS> in the aneuploid polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope <EOS>
<SOS> a frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin <EOS>
<SOS> dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei <EOS>
<SOS> enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found <EOS>
<SOS> the antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds <EOS>
<SOS> until twenty years ago aspirin phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections trauma small surgeries but also for tension headache and other painful conditions <EOS>
<SOS> during the last decades this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2 arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> some of them e g <EOS>
<SOS> ibuprofen ketoprofen and naproxen have been given over the counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions <EOS>
<SOS> a 38 year old man presented with an intracranial extra axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma <EOS>
<SOS> meningeal melanocytoma is a rare benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults <EOS>
<SOS> it shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle shaped cells often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin <EOS>
<SOS> it usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies <EOS>
<SOS> its immunohistological profile with s 100 protein vimentin and hmb 45 positive tumour cells is similar to that of primary or metastatic malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> this differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications <EOS>
<SOS> therefore everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma <EOS>
<SOS> a 54 year old obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face especially of the upper and lower eyelids <EOS>
<SOS> initially the swelling occured intermittently but after <NUM> years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields <EOS>
<SOS> neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac renal or endocrinological disease <EOS>
<SOS> there was no suggestion of a storage disease <EOS>
<SOS> skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic melkersson rosenthal syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields <EOS>
<SOS> treatment with clofazimine <NUM> mg daily was initiated <EOS>
<SOS> regular follow up visits over <NUM> months revealed no evidence of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later <EOS>
<SOS> the relatives refused an autopsy <EOS>
<SOS> the definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities <EOS>
<SOS> an 81 year old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train of four ratios of <NUM> and 0 5 respectively after two successive anaesthesia procedures enflurane n2o o2 vecuronium succinylcholine sequence for transurethral prostate resection <EOS>
<SOS> although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first 65 min period of anaesthesia 1 5 mg vecuronium for precurarization <NUM> mg succinylcholine for intubation <NUM> mg vecuronium repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second 30 min period of anaesthesia 1 mg vecuronium for precurarization <NUM> mg succinylcholine for intubation had hardly any effect so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of <NUM> h laboratory analysis revealed homozygous atypical plasma cholinesterase 790 u l dibucaine number 23 genotype e cdata lefbop a cdata clobop opnbop 1 cdata clobop e cdata lefbop a cdata clobop opnbop 1 cdata clobop <EOS>
<SOS> this retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine induced phase ii block in both instances as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the degree of block transformation and thus the available time are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here <EOS>
<SOS> it must be assumed that a complete phase ii block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia the purely competitive component train of four ratio 0 1 was easily antagonized by neostigmine <EOS>
<SOS> at the time of the attempted antagonism after the second shorter period of anaesthesia however block transformation was still incomplete train of four ratio 0 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation <EOS>
<SOS> the ph1 negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases cmpd are described and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given <EOS>
<SOS> these are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2 331 patients with cmpds among a total of 34 160 patients referred between <NUM> january <NUM> and <NUM> june <NUM> to the bone marrow registry <EOS>
<SOS> these cases of cmpd break down into the main groups as follows cml <NUM> megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia <NUM> essential thrombocythemia <NUM> and polycythemia vera <NUM> <NUM> of cases were unclassifiable <EOS>
<SOS> histological progress in each group is characterized by 1 increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes 2 increasing fibrosis and 3 excess of blasts <EOS>
<SOS> these three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively <EOS>
<SOS> a staging system with four stages from <NUM> to <NUM> for each of the three features is introduced <EOS>
<SOS> its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop sies <EOS>
<SOS> chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus <EOS>
<SOS> for diagnosis operative management and follow up magnetic resonance imaging was useful which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement gadolinium <EOS>
<SOS> in adults operative therapy is favored <EOS>
<SOS> due to new techniques arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy <EOS>
<SOS> according to the stage of the disease drilling or curettage removal or fixation of the fragment autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed <EOS>
<SOS> all procedures can be managed arthroscopically <EOS>
<SOS> general psychotherapy is not a new type of therapy but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically oriented psychotherapists <EOS>
<SOS> the contents of this model are defined <EOS>
<SOS> arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods <EOS>
<SOS> the procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived <EOS>
<SOS> a consistency theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other <EOS>
<SOS> the advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in the federal republic of germany no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all <NUM> german heart centers performing cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates <EOS>
<SOS> all randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage ii and iv disease <EOS>
<SOS> in our opinion this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials maximum 18 <EOS>
<SOS> estimate that a 40 50 complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen <EOS>
<SOS> to date such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable t2 t3 n0 n2 disease <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages <EOS>
<SOS> patients pts were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin 5 fu prior to surgery and radiotherapy arm a <NUM> pts or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy arm b <NUM> pts <EOS>
<SOS> patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease <EOS>
<SOS> the observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer cr 43 pr 37 nr 15 pd 5 <EOS>
<SOS> after a follow up of 12 96 months overall survival was 58 in arm a and 45 in arm b n s <EOS>
<SOS> disease free survival in arm a 61 is statistically significantly better than in arm b 43 p 0 03 <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage t2 t3 and n0 n2 disease prior to surgery <EOS>
<SOS> minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery lima bypass surgery to the lad <EOS>
<SOS> this novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis this approach is gaining widespread acceptance <EOS>
<SOS> a steadily growing number of patients with proximal lad lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates now approaching 98 short term patency <EOS>
<SOS> in a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized a limited methodological approach magnified the problem <EOS>
<SOS> our experience and the treatment results debridement drainage and external fixation are presented <EOS>
<SOS> the methodology complications and final results are also given for <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods <EOS>
<SOS> the time to consolidation without complications was <NUM> weeks <MOB> and with complications deep infections chronic osteomyelitis <NUM> weeks <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> in total there was one poor result with angulation shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation <EOS>
<SOS> the average follow up was <NUM> months 1 34 months <EOS>
<SOS> our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation <EOS>
<SOS> under war conditions primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results <EOS>
<SOS> minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly <EOS>
<SOS> introduction of the computed tomography index ctdi and the multiple scan average dose msad has led to standardization of the dose description in ct examinations <EOS>
<SOS> despite the use of these dose parameters many different dosages are reported in the literature for different ct methods <EOS>
<SOS> in addition there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional ct helical ct and hrct used in chest examinations <EOS>
<SOS> the variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose i e beam geometry beam quality scanner geometry generation and operating parameters <EOS>
<SOS> in addition ct dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and ct dosimetry and using similar operating parameters show similar results in ct dosimetry for conventional and helical ct on the other hand dosages for hrct were greatly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> this was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing <EOS>
<SOS> central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli <EOS>
<SOS> despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about <NUM> in trauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too <EOS>
<SOS> in haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated mortality rates of up to <NUM> are reported in literature <EOS>
<SOS> after introduction of the heart and lung machine in the surgical concept of therapy survival rates have increased significantly <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after cpr <EOS>
<SOS> in a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making <EOS>
<SOS> first of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial <EOS>
<SOS> later on accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> if histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention <EOS>
<SOS> a rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case <EOS>
<SOS> thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of the importance of skin diseases in africa south of the sahara dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems <EOS>
<SOS> aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes <EOS>
<SOS> however the interpretation of mri in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age and sex dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case of a 26 year old patient a tilelayer by profession with a history of a fall from a height of <NUM> meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture <EOS>
<SOS> the emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient glasgow coma scale <NUM> points with no recordable blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> after two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen <EOS>
<SOS> with a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit <EOS>
<SOS> during transfer the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated <EOS>
<SOS> on arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro femoral cannulation was supported by a heart lung machine circulation <EOS>
<SOS> through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated <EOS>
<SOS> the heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of <EOS>
<SOS> the patient could be discharged from hospital on the 18th postoperative day in absolute good health <EOS>
<SOS> since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families <EOS>
<SOS> the specific features of mitochondrial genetics however hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in mendelian diseases <EOS>
<SOS> empirical risks were recently provided for melas and merrf syndromes and for leber hereditary optic neuropathy <EOS>
<SOS> in melas and merff higher levels of mutant mtdna in the mothers blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring <EOS>
<SOS> chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and kearns sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring <EOS>
<SOS> as leigh syndrome is found with maternal autosomal recessive or x chromosomal transmission the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling <EOS>
<SOS> prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant dna in chorionic villi and in <NUM> clinically relevant tissues such as brain <EOS>
<SOS> an accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by matthias grünewald in his painting the temptation of st anthony which is part of the isenheim altar piece 1512 1516 which is now exhibited in colmar alsace <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast sutton in <NUM> only described a leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark <EOS>
<SOS> the term sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation grünewald naevus <EOS>
<SOS> in women with breast cancer staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor <EOS>
<SOS> the most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic tnm classification <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data <EOS>
<SOS> tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response <EOS>
<SOS> thus more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> this article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities mammography ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine used for breast cancer staging <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging <EOS>
<SOS> the lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot <EOS>

<SOS> still is disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult onset still is disease <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic criteria include typical rash arthralgias bouts of fever and leukocytosis as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly liver dysfunctions non infectious angina and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> we report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the rash is a finding with high sensitivity <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent <EOS>
<SOS> during an acute flare of the rash gentle friction induces erythematous isomorphic koebner phenomena which as we describe here for the first time may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash <EOS>
<SOS> objective patients in a surgical intensive care unit icu have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death <EOS>
<SOS> since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult it was recommended to obtain routine nose throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient <EOS>
<SOS> methods in <NUM> patients of our cardio surgical icu routine nose throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro organisms and resistance to antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> of these <NUM> patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation and additional blood cultures were obtained <EOS>
<SOS> antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose throat swabs or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative <EOS>
<SOS> results of the <NUM> patients with systemic inflammation <NUM> had blood cultures positive for microbes <EOS>
<SOS> of these <NUM> patients <NUM> received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab <EOS>
<SOS> however in only <NUM> of the <NUM> patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes <EOS>
<SOS> while positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions routine nose throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22 of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> in addition in almost 40 of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical <EOS>
<SOS> as a result we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of defensivity measured by validity scales of personality inventories mmpi k fpi r giessen test on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in <NUM> patients treated with inpatient client centered therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in general psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity <EOS>
<SOS> 25 of patients who denied psychopathology at admission did so at discharge and to some extent at follow up demonstrating an especially good outcome means <EOS>
<SOS> relative improvement effect sizes however was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales <EOS>

<SOS> despite the great number of publications during the last <NUM> years concerning the indication technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities <EOS>
<SOS> because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible <EOS>
<SOS> conventional x rays completed by special projections like the ala and obturator view and a ct scan allow determination of the fracture type the letournel judet classification or the ao classification <EOS>
<SOS> the most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient i e age general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment <EOS>
<SOS> determination of the intact part of the weight bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the larger the intact roof arc the better the prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> together with the x ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> early active motion of the injured limb followed by walking exercises with partial weight bearing are important aspects of nonoperative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment is recommended in non displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> our clinical and radiological follow up of <NUM> patients with acetabular fractures from the years <MOB> showed that the majority were treated conservatively approx <EOS>
<SOS> the functional result after an average observation period of more than <NUM> months was good or excellent based on the merle d aubigné score <EOS>
<SOS> we feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non competitive therapeutic methods <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type the individual circumstances of the patient and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment can lead to excellent long term results <EOS>
<SOS> problem there is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain clbp patients <EOS>
<SOS> the literature on these patients reports that mobility endurance trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity <EOS>
<SOS> chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons <EOS>
<SOS> methods our study group consisted of <NUM> disabled clbp patients 44 female <NUM> male average age <NUM> years who underwent a multidisciplinary 8 week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support instruction endurance training strength exercises behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy <EOS>
<SOS> initially these patients where compared with <NUM> asymptomatic persons 44 female <NUM> male average age <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were investigated before and after treatment and at intervals of <NUM> and <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison <EOS>
<SOS> physical assessment included a medical examination mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain changes in the lumbar spine revealed by x ray studies according to herron and turner 50 rating of physical impairment according to waddell 117 flexibility length of hamstrings muscles slr test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the swiss group of spring 102 and isokinetic measurements lido back tests of lifting capacity lido lift and in part of general endurance on a cycle ergometer case <NUM> marquette <EOS>
<SOS> results physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced slr shortened hamstrings and decreased spinal mobility <EOS>
<SOS> patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals <EOS>
<SOS> the results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group <EOS>
<SOS> in principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines <EOS>
<SOS> cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients <EOS>
<SOS> at the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group <EOS>
<SOS> with time however training effects gradually decreased <EOS>
<SOS> the success of treatment return to work absence from work pain reduction use of medical care was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain <EOS>
<SOS> the only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group <EOS>
<SOS> however even clbp patients with long term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program <EOS>
<SOS> back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> because of loss of condition during the time after treatment regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> overall treatment of clbp has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency dependent <EOS>
<SOS> to date this has still not been fully investigated or understood <EOS>
<SOS> there remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution <EOS>
<SOS> the presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens <EOS>
<SOS> motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations <EOS>
<SOS> using a sound stimulus the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by fourier transform <EOS>

<SOS> even if we take into account that in the gdr there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts in our view the intended dynamic group therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> it represents a specific therapeutical development of the former gdr which is strongly oriented at social norms <EOS>
<SOS> it is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group that means at the manifest conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy <EOS>

<SOS> 3 pathologic findings ureteral leak ureteropelvic junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated <EOS>
<SOS> the imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and urologically relevant <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion fmru can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system <EOS>
<SOS> the infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication which is hard to eradicate <EOS>
<SOS> the results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to <NUM> fifty five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial <EOS>
<SOS> twenty one patients had an infection of the femur <EOS>
<SOS> thirty four patients had a primary infection of the nail twenty one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing <EOS>
<SOS> all patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation <EOS>
<SOS> at the time of the follow up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort <EOS>
<SOS> the mean time of observation was 10 1 <NUM> <NUM> 4 9 years <EOS>
<SOS> all patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection compared to <NUM> of those with multiple operations prior to nailing <EOS>
<SOS> at the time of the follow up all fractures had healed <EOS>
<SOS> 85 of the patients performed full weight bearing <EOS>
<SOS> 32 patients 91 had good or excellent rom of the adjacent joints <EOS>
<SOS> the discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment augmented repair and reconstruction with autografts are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to 1997 <NUM> patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair trevira ligament augmentation of <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> isolated and <NUM> combined ruptures <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate <EOS>
<SOS> investigation of <NUM> patients in <NUM> cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made <EOS>
<SOS> osseous avulsion had good results in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in <NUM> of <NUM> cases and instability of <NUM> in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the medial range lysholm score was <NUM> 21 6 the oak score showed <NUM> very good and <NUM> good results <NUM> fair and <NUM> bad results <EOS>
<SOS> using the ikdc score led to <NUM> very good and <NUM> good results <NUM> fair and <NUM> bad results <EOS>
<SOS> using subjective criteria <NUM> patients described results as very good or good <NUM> fair and <NUM> bad <EOS>
<SOS> posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in <NUM> of cases and good or fair results in only <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> we think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft <EOS>
<SOS> through cooperation between the german contact dermatitis research group dkg and the information network of departments of dermatology ivdk results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in germany <EOS>
<SOS> for this study data from <NUM> departments of dermatology <MOB> patients were evaluated retrospectively and separately for <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> with decreasing frequency nickel fragrance mix balsam of peru and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol l 101 and palladium <EOS>
<SOS> differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995 referring to subgroups of patients defined by gender age localization of eczema geographical region occupation sensitization and particular problems <EOS>
<SOS> in men percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women <EOS>
<SOS> younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations <EOS>
<SOS> medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema <EOS>
<SOS> a comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations <EOS>
<SOS> the spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population <EOS>
<SOS> patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population <EOS>
<SOS> sex and age adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent <EOS>
<SOS> differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin bt induce a localized long lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the bt dose administered and that is free of major side effects <EOS>
<SOS> with this profile bt can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities <EOS>
<SOS> these disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> they are difficult to treat with conventional methods can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of bt in rehabilitative neurology <EOS>
<SOS> regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome five main indication groups are identified 1 improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles 2 relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles 3 improvement of patient care 4 avoidance of sequelae in joints tendons ligaments and teeth 5 various special indications <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with sleep related breathing disorders srbd it is assumed that apnea associated changes of hemodynamics blood gases and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep <EOS>
<SOS> this investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without srbd <EOS>
<SOS> currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available <EOS>
<SOS> the novel tumorassociated antigen melanoma inhibitory activity mia is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it is metastatic lesions <EOS>
<SOS> persistent atrial fibrillation af is associated with shortened action potential duration apd and reduced atrial refractoriness <EOS>
<SOS> remodeling of ion currents responsible for ap morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent af <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac l type ca2 channel and the mrna transcription of the cardiac l type ca2 channel subunits in patients with persistent af compared to patients in sinus rhythm sr <EOS>
<SOS> right atrial appendages of <NUM> patients in sr and of <NUM> patients with af were used for myocyte isolations to record l type ca2 currents ica l by the patch clamp technique <EOS>
<SOS> right atrial appendages of <NUM> patients in sr and of <NUM> patients with af served as sources for determining the mrna expression of the l type ca2 channel 1c 2 a and b c subunits by semiquantitative rt pcr <EOS>
<SOS> ica l density was reduced by 70 p 0 001 in af patients compared to the sinus rhythm group <EOS>
<SOS> cell sizes expressed as cell capacitance were identical in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> mrna expressions of the 1c subunit and the b c subunits were reduced in af patients by 18 9 p 0 05 and 77 7 p 0 005 respectively while mrna transcriptions of the 2 and the a subunits were not significantly different between sr and af patients <EOS>
<SOS> a decrease in the availability of functional l type ca2 channels in af patients due to reduced 1c subunit and substantial lack of b c subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf apd and refractory periods in af thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of af <EOS>
<SOS> 34 patients aged <NUM> months to 20years underwent transcatheter occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils cook <EOS>
<SOS> eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a rashkind occluder <NUM> patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> patients had a large ductus with a diameter between <NUM> and <NUM> mm all had systolic diastolic murmurs <EOS>
<SOS> all other patients had ductus diameters below <NUM> mm three of them had systolic diastolic murmurs <NUM> had systolic murmurs and <NUM> patients had no murmur at all <EOS>
<SOS> the ductus was closed in <NUM> patients using artrial access only in <NUM> patients via a venous and in <NUM> patients both via venous and arterial catheterization <EOS>
<SOS> one coil was used in <NUM> patients <NUM> coils in 9 and <NUM> coils in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> there were no complications of the intervention <EOS>
<SOS> within <NUM> hours <NUM> patients 93 had complete closure of the ductus and <NUM> patients 94 after <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> coil embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation <EOS>
<SOS> the volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> it seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient <EOS>
<SOS> as shown by a number of studies preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance <EOS>
<SOS> abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications <EOS>
<SOS> extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets <EOS>
<SOS> a more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings <EOS>
<SOS> to achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on day of surgery cancellations <EOS>
<SOS> there is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing <EOS>
<SOS> the anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary <EOS>
<SOS> according to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease <EOS>
<SOS> careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated <EOS>
<SOS> the botryoid odontogenic cyst boc is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst <EOS>
<SOS> the origin of the boc can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the boc is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between <NUM> and <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> most of the <NUM> published articles of boc have shown high rates of recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> histopathologically the boc is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin nonkeratinized epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> clusters of glycogen rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining <EOS>
<SOS> for the clinician the differentiation of the boc from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant <EOS>
<SOS> one case of a large boc 65 year old male boc regio 33 45 diameter <NUM> cm radiographically and histologically multilocular is presented with a review of the literature including the therapeutic management and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin ck <NUM> implicates the histogenetic origin of the boc from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands <EOS>
<SOS> the expression of ck <NUM> and the lack of expression of p53 as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the boc may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst <EOS>
<SOS> within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill we examined <NUM> schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program <EOS>
<SOS> the course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3 year period by means of annual follow up examinations <EOS>
<SOS> the sample comprised <NUM> men and <NUM> women with an average age of <NUM> years sd 8 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> years 22 of the patients were integrated into the general labor market 26 had sheltered employment 23 were still in work therapy and 29 were unemployed <EOS>
<SOS> besides the patients subjective expectations early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration <EOS>
<SOS> outpatient work therapy is a contemporary effective organizational form of sociotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> it may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology <EOS>
<SOS> objective based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> this hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial <EOS>
<SOS> aim of study goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in germany <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound contrast agent is used in color doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels <EOS>
<SOS> we present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained <EOS>
<SOS> up until now <NUM> patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined <EOS>
<SOS> conventional b scan sonography was supplemented by non contrast color doppler flow imaging <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the indication <NUM> g levovist in bolus or <NUM> g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of <NUM> or <NUM> mg ml <EOS>
<SOS> the administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the doppler signals <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> to <NUM> s after injection an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected <EOS>
<SOS> the fractioned injection of <NUM> g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than <NUM> min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent <EOS>
<SOS> in 64 of the lymph nodes vessels could only be identified with the administration of levovist <EOS>
<SOS> the general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83 of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> the lymph node supplying vessels were identified in <NUM> of <NUM> patients after the injection of contrast media <EOS>
<SOS> additional information which was gained in <NUM> patients increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept <EOS>
<SOS> in three cases the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy <EOS>
<SOS> by applying signal enhancer in color doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded <EOS>
<SOS> non syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness nsrd is one of the most common human sensory disorders <EOS>
<SOS> mutations in the connexin <NUM> gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non syndromic deafness in different populations <EOS>
<SOS> laser induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system <EOS>
<SOS> in an ex vivo test series the specially developed application system diffuser tip with <NUM> j had a higher thermic loading capacity than the ringmode applicator with <NUM> j thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of <NUM> cm3 <EOS>
<SOS> the results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four phase connective tissue organization within a 6 month period <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the same laser energy 4200 j was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of <NUM> cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study <EOS>
<SOS> by temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion pringle is maneuver during laser application the effective volume could be increased to <NUM> cm3 p 0 01 using an optical beam splitter <EOS>
<SOS> these results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction amplicor test for the direct detection of chlamydia trachomatis <EOS>
<SOS> the results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique <EOS>
<SOS> using cell culture a urogenital c trachomatis infection could be detected in <NUM> of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the amplicor test yielded a positive result in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> referred to the detection rate of the amplicor test and that of the cell culture sensitivity was 91 2 for the test sensitivity and 79 1 for the cell culture <EOS>
<SOS> the specificity of both techniques was 100 when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered <EOS>
<SOS> in accordance with other studies this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of c trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections <EOS>
<SOS> incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear <EOS>
<SOS> neurogenic pulmonary edema npe is characterized as an acute protein rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure <EOS>
<SOS> npe is infrequently diagnosed usually in association with head trauma <EOS>
<SOS> pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to npe cardiac complications are frequently observed most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> typical ecg changes are repolarization abnormalities similar to those observed in coronary heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> the ck mb may be slightly elevated echocardiographic findings show a depressed left ventricular function <EOS>
<SOS> pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines <EOS>
<SOS> for adequate treatment close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions <EOS>
<SOS> benign non parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or ct scan <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 68 year old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct <EOS>
<SOS> due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm <EOS>
<SOS> this review summarizes briefly pathophysiology clinical definitions pathogenesis risk factors diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke <EOS>
<SOS> ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow <EOS>
<SOS> we focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration the therapeutic time window the role of excitatory neurotransmitters ca2 influx free radicals and the development of ischemic brain edema <EOS>
<SOS> based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized <EOS>
<SOS> this includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure ecg oxygen and blood glucose concentration and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply <EOS>
<SOS> since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination laboratory baseline vascular ultrasound cranial ct scan ecg and echocardiography is emphazised <EOS>
<SOS> based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> new data about the effectiveness of basic care treatment of edema neuroprotective agents and thrombolysis is presented <EOS>
<SOS> indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin vitamin k antagonists antiplatelet drugs and surgical procedures are summarized <EOS>
<SOS> longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in <NUM> patients during a 3 year period by using the vertical vram and transverse rectus abdominis muscle tram flap <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> three vram tram flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region <EOS>
<SOS> nine out of <NUM> pedicled vram or tram flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency supercharging <EOS>
<SOS> therefore operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable <EOS>
<SOS> adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required <EOS>
<SOS> two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections <EOS>
<SOS> lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope <EOS>
<SOS> axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures <EOS>
<SOS> translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal double angulation <EOS>
<SOS> derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the ring part of a hybrid frame <EOS>
<SOS> unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail <EOS>
<SOS> pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae <EOS>
<SOS> background morphological changes in the corneal surface after prk may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity but also in changes of contrast sensitivity <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to investigate whether prk has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars <EOS>
<SOS> calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56 year old patient <EOS>
<SOS> remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification <EOS>
<SOS> differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection <EOS>
<SOS> the osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access <EOS>
<SOS> the obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process <EOS>
<SOS> in these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice <EOS>
<SOS> we review <NUM> patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique <EOS>
<SOS> indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall 3 a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall 4 and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall 1 <EOS>
<SOS> the frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up period was <NUM> years 11 months to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> all patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ent examination and radiological assessment by ct scan or mri <EOS>
<SOS> the overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent <EOS>
<SOS> there were no serious complications nor any recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of an infant with waterhouse friderichsen syndrome in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within <NUM> months after the illness <EOS>
<SOS> spinocerebellar ataxia type <NUM> sca7 belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias adca <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> other common signs are slow saccades external ophthalmoplegia and pyramidal tract signs <EOS>
<SOS> the disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable cag trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin <NUM> on chromosome <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> sca7 is a rare disorder <EOS>
<SOS> the first case in germany was described only recently <EOS>
<SOS> we report two additional patients father and son with the molecular genetic diagnosis of sca7 <EOS>
<SOS> the father carries a trinucleotide expansion of <NUM> cag repeats the son <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> normal alleles range from <NUM> to <NUM> cag repeats <EOS>
<SOS> both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> we found a pronounced anticipation earlier disease onset in subsequent generations which is highly characteristic of cag repeat disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in the following contribution the under proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job integrated self directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> tick borne encephalitis tbe is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality of the central european form is 0 7 2 <EOS>
<SOS> active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> patients with tbe aquired in middle hessen between <NUM> and <NUM> 2 in 1997 <EOS>
<SOS> after repeated csf and serum testing the tbe specific antibodies were found in all <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> in one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the initial csf analysis were atypical in <NUM> cases high cell count of <NUM> cells mm3 total protein up to <NUM> g l <EOS>
<SOS> the endemic region for tbe has expanded in northern direction into middle hessen a region in which lyme borreliosis is also endemic <EOS>
<SOS> thus true double infections are possible <EOS>
<SOS> this and the initially frequently atypical csf findings make the differential diagnosis difficult <EOS>
<SOS> therefore repetitive csf and blood examinations are recommended <EOS>
<SOS> nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma <EOS>
<SOS> although they are chemically different there are many similarities in their mechanism of action <EOS>
<SOS> in provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests allergen exercise but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as so2 challenge <EOS>
<SOS> very few studies compared the two drugs <EOS>
<SOS> in children only one study was done showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium <EOS>
<SOS> thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil the other being proven effect of steroid sparing which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium <EOS>
<SOS> both drugs are recommended as first line agents in mild persistent asthma <EOS>
<SOS> background we evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens as illustrated by typical clinical pictures on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy induced benign changes following surgery and or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology cct mri or function spect pet <EOS>
<SOS> current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of imt spect and fdg pet in the detection of recurrence and in vivo grading <EOS>
<SOS> thirty nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow up were studied by fdg pet and imt spect <EOS>
<SOS> thirty four of <NUM> patients showed recurrences in <NUM> cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed <EOS>
<SOS> all high grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods <EOS>
<SOS> imt spect showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low grade tumors at recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to imt spect fdg pet supports sufficient in vivo grading <EOS>
<SOS> both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of imt spect and fdg pet in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade <EOS>
<SOS> a 22 year old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ent clinic of berlin buch <EOS>
<SOS> histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst <EOS>
<SOS> worldwide only about <NUM> cases are known <EOS>
<SOS> we describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy <EOS>
<SOS> no abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area <EOS>
<SOS> a preoperative <NUM> tc thyroid scan and mri study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy <EOS>
<SOS> transforming growth factor 1 tgf 1 is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions <EOS>
<SOS> we wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of tgf 1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the tgf 1 blood level was analysed in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients group i the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> the tgf 1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer n 157 and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia n 85 <NUM> <NUM> pg ml versus <NUM> <NUM> pg ml sd <NUM> <NUM> pg ml <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the blood was taken 6 12 months after radical prostatectomy group ii <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significant difference between the patients with a psa progress and without psa progress after <EOS>
<SOS> our results suggest that tgf 1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the patients motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined <EOS>
<SOS> 228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies ins food intolerance food drug hypersensitivities dru and urticaria urt were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments <EOS>
<SOS> patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance <EOS>
<SOS> patient education was the favourite technique for the patients food 78 urt 57 dru 24 ins 17 followed by relaxation treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self responsibility a feeling of helplessness and social limitations <EOS>
<SOS> if strong indication criteria are applied psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of that the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support <EOS>
<SOS> the definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp <EOS>
<SOS> at present all non physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature <EOS>
<SOS> many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water <EOS>
<SOS> here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life <EOS>
<SOS> only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand many plants produce socalled hyto estrogens particularly soy products are rich in phyto estrogens but their high consumption in asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints <EOS>
<SOS> hence not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health in fact some of them clearly phyto estrogens may have beneficial effects <EOS>
<SOS> germany is new protection against infection act infektionsschutzgesetz will take effect on january 1 <NUM> <EOS>

<SOS> on endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically <EOS>
<SOS> biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae <EOS>
<SOS> these clinical endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> paediatric cases age at diagnosis 6 9 years have been published so far <EOS>
<SOS> the interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis mean 3 7 years range <NUM> week to <NUM> years is remarkably long in childhood cases <EOS>

<SOS> there is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease <EOS>
<SOS> the ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options <EOS>
<SOS> discussion pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses <EOS>
<SOS> a typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed <EOS>
<SOS> in a comparative analysis of <NUM> studies maximal androgen deprivation mad was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation <EOS>
<SOS> thus mad cannot be regarded as the new gold standard <EOS>
<SOS> most trials focus on quality of life which given the palliative aim of the treatment deserves special attention <EOS>
<SOS> this aspect has not yet been evaluated however in the largest multicenter study intergroup study <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain mad treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> the synergistic effects of lhrh agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated <EOS>
<SOS> since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum psa levels under mad does not delay progression the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not mad should be begun <EOS>
<SOS> a case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s c injections of either low molecular weight heparin or conventional high molecular weight heparin to a 75 year old woman is reported <EOS>
<SOS> this rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications <EOS>
<SOS> therefore perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events <EOS>
<SOS> in patients above the age of <NUM> years the ecg is a basic investigation often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases <EOS>
<SOS> stress testing and in special cases stress echocardiography or scintigraphy the latter only in those patients in which exercise is impossible can detect significant coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> the vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> however prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery <EOS>

<SOS> up to now only <NUM> cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported <EOS>
<SOS> although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation <EOS>
<SOS> after conservative management had failed a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the characteristics of interstitial cystitis verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> introduction abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor like abdominal masses <EOS>
<SOS> methods we report a case of a 49 year old patient with an intrauterine device <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> after sonography computerized tomography gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall <EOS>
<SOS> pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis <EOS>
<SOS> results based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions this case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass <EOS>
<SOS> after a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy <EOS>
<SOS> long term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches co operation of several professions and regard for the views of patients and relatives <EOS>

<SOS> continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration <EOS>
<SOS> indications for adding on antidepressants lithium carbamazepine benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed as well as treatment of negative symptoms depression and management of treatment resistant symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> in the context of a stable long term relationship the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action <EOS>
<SOS> effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited <EOS>
<SOS> the best results are achieved by social skills training <EOS>
<SOS> social therapy which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient is of paramount importance <EOS>
<SOS> improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long term social rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> interventions based on the ee concept are highly effective but are rarely used <EOS>

<SOS> the effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension type headache was examined in the design of a randomized placebo controlled double blind crossover study for the first time <EOS>
<SOS> the preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo <EOS>
<SOS> the liquid test preparation contained <NUM> g of peppermint oil and ethanol 90 ad <NUM> test preparation li 170 lichtwer pharma berlin the placebo was a <NUM> ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes <EOS>
<SOS> the reference preparation contained <NUM> mg acetaminophen the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance <EOS>
<SOS> the study included the analysis of <NUM> headache attacks of <NUM> patients of both sexes ranging between <NUM> and <NUM> years of age suffering from tension type headache in accordance with the ihs classification <EOS>
<SOS> four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double blind randomized crossover design <EOS>
<SOS> each headache attack was treated by the application of <NUM> capsules of the oral medication 100 mg of acetaminophen or placebo and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation peppermint oil or placebo solution <EOS>
<SOS> the oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after <NUM> and <NUM> minutes <EOS>
<SOS> using a headache diary the headache parameters were assessed after 15 30 <NUM> and <NUM> minutes <EOS>
<SOS> compared to the application of placebo a <NUM> peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after <NUM> minutes p 0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> this significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period <EOS>
<SOS> acetaminophen too proved to be efficient compared to placebo p 0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significant difference between the efficacy of <NUM> mg of acetaminophen and <NUM> peppermint oil in ethanol solution <EOS>
<SOS> simultaneous application of <NUM> mg of acetaminophen and <NUM> peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold however <EOS>
<SOS> the patients reported no adverse events <EOS>
<SOS> this controlled study showed for the first time that a <NUM> peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension type headache <EOS>
<SOS> peppermint oil thus proves to be a well tolerated and cost effective alternative to usual therapies <EOS>
<SOS> the positive results of several multi center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years <EOS>
<SOS> it was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease <EOS>
<SOS> to improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the german speaking european countries <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other <NUM> therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence <EOS>
<SOS> dislocated metacarpal v fractures fixed by percutaneous kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to foucher <EOS>
<SOS> twenty five patients were operated on in a 3 year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined <EOS>
<SOS> six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction <EOS>
<SOS> one patient suffering from an early stage of sudeck is dystrophy was healed and no other complications appeared <EOS>
<SOS> three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore recommend intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal v fractures <EOS>
<SOS> aspiration of toxic substances foreign material bacterially contaminated secretions or water near drowning either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction and pulmonary infection might develop <EOS>
<SOS> respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation <EOS>
<SOS> mortality varies between <NUM> and 70 depending on patients studied and on the nature and amount of aspirated material <EOS>
<SOS> the major cause of death is acute respiratory failure <EOS>
<SOS> the onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid <EOS>
<SOS> therefore therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late <EOS>
<SOS> more importantly oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop <EOS>
<SOS> prognosis in near drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> a rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near drowning victim <EOS>
<SOS> anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult <EOS>
<SOS> one third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage <EOS>
<SOS> the overall mortality of near drowning is about 11 <EOS>
<SOS> pathophysiological aspects diagnostic procedures pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> background semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods <EOS>
<SOS> recently professional anaesthesiologists organizations have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> these recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality <EOS>
<SOS> hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> however no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized controlled trials <EOS>
<SOS> four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia related deaths <EOS>
<SOS> pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique <EOS>
<SOS> transcutaneous po2 is considered mainly for historical reasons <EOS>
<SOS> near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> the increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions <EOS>
<SOS> one of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis <EOS>
<SOS> stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies stress i and benestent i but only in large 3 0mm vessels with short denovo lesions <EOS>
<SOS> despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies the advantage for stents remained small about 10 less restenosis and appeared to decrease with time following intervention <EOS>
<SOS> there is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an unrestricted strategy <EOS>
<SOS> this concern was expressed in the acc expert consensus document which was published recently jacc 28 no 3 september <NUM> <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> removal of the arterial sheath immediately after ptca is desirable for patients reduces the medical staff is workload and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay <EOS>
<SOS> although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible <EOS>
<SOS> while partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the vasoseal collagen prototype device has been previously reported similar complications occurring with the angio sealtm device were not published <EOS>
<SOS> in this report we describe a 54 year old female patient height <NUM> cm weight <NUM> kg who was transferred for ptca following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> immediately after ptca the angio sealtm device was deployed utilizing standard technique <EOS>
<SOS> no difficulties were encountered during device deployment however immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred <EOS>
<SOS> due to the inadequacy of hemostasis heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications <EOS>
<SOS> following this the desired hemostasis quickly occurred but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the complete angio sealtm system anchor including collagen was located intravasculary and removed during surgery <EOS>
<SOS> deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological <EOS>
<SOS> during growth the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes <EOS>
<SOS> the femoral neck shaft angle decreases from <NUM> ° on average at birth to <NUM> ° on average at the end of growth <EOS>
<SOS> the lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of an extensive literature search dimdi medline status at june 1992 the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables <EOS>
<SOS> the contact urticariogens can be divided into 1 chemically defined substances and 2 chemically undefined biological materials <EOS>
<SOS> the causes most frequently encountered in <NUM> professions are given <EOS>
<SOS> numerous agents are known for medical professions physicians nurses dentists and dental technicians veterinary surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> today the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber gloves condoms tubes balloons etc <EOS>
<SOS> when testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons rub test prick test scratch chamber test <EOS>
<SOS> for some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test rast is available <EOS>
<SOS> in the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic ige mediated or non immunologic toxic or pseudoallergic <EOS>
<SOS> when there is a high degree of sensitization e g <EOS>
<SOS> to latex professional activities must be severely restricted or even completely discontinued in rare cases <EOS>
<SOS> purpose to find and describe potential mri criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones <EOS>
<SOS> 2 agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive analgesic and sedative properties <EOS>
<SOS> platelets bear 2 receptors on the cell surface <EOS>
<SOS> stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation <EOS>
<SOS> the present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2 agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2 receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation <EOS>
<SOS> prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians <EOS>
<SOS> acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain <EOS>
<SOS> the basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia the clinical symptoms the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options <EOS>
<SOS> time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30 60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in <NUM> to <NUM> hours <EOS>
<SOS> with 30 of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or ptca <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism phpt is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis <EOS>
<SOS> despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal invasive surgery thereof success cannot be guaranteed <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage free atraumatic anatomical orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation <EOS>
<SOS> success is based on the four pillars of the hpt surgery history embryology with anatomy neck surgery and experience <EOS>
<SOS> by means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in <NUM> patients with phpt from <NUM> until 1998 we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of phpt <EOS>

<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis ms as indicated by clinical and mri data <EOS>
<SOS> however the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective analysis we report on <NUM> patients with severe relapsing remitting 9 patients and secondary progressive ms with superimposed exacerbations 6 patients treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our clinical research group from july <NUM> to october <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> eleven of these patients 73 were treated with azathioprine interferon beta 1b or cyclophosphamide before <EOS>
<SOS> the patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least <NUM> months 19 <NUM> months with a single dose of <NUM> mg m2 monthly for the first three months <EOS>
<SOS> thereafter infusions were repeated every <NUM> months total dose <NUM> mg <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> the annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3 0 1 5 in the year before therapy to 0 5 0 5 during therapy <EOS>
<SOS> nine patients 60 were stabilised while four patients 27 showed an improvement of disability <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects <EOS>
<SOS> these results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in ms patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication <EOS>
<SOS> interstitial cystitis ic represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging <EOS>
<SOS> strict nih criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes <EOS>
<SOS> their routine application would miss large proportions of ic patients <EOS>

<SOS> large voided volumes functional capacity 250 cc or longer micturition intervals 2 h absence of nocturia or symptom free periods reduce the likelihood of ic <EOS>
<SOS> further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests infection cytology in situ carcinoma ultrasound calculi bulks anomalies and urodynamics in selected cases <EOS>
<SOS> bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value since functional low volume bladders can be mechanically extendable <EOS>
<SOS> cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for ic during which 90 of ic patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension <EOS>
<SOS> biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy <EOS>
<SOS> potassium leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity <EOS>

<SOS> according to semiotics which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs objects and interpretants pain is considered to be a sign significant with very different meanings significance either as a naturalistic symptom of disease or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context <EOS>
<SOS> when following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms <EOS>
<SOS> in graeco roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body <EOS>
<SOS> especially in the corpus hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century b c this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed <EOS>
<SOS> aristotle 4th century b c celsus 1st century a d and the famous experimental physiologist galen 2nd century a d agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception <EOS>
<SOS> it was galen who added the disturbance of function functio laesa as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well known cardinal signs of celsus rubor calor tumor dolor <EOS>
<SOS> he also coined the term µk to characterize an attack of migraine <EOS>
<SOS> in algotherapy galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand pain was designed as a multi dimensional symbol by the famous graeco roman epic poets <EOS>
<SOS> in homer is odyssey 8th century b c pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero is leg like an identification tag whereas in virgil is aeneids 1st century b c pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess venus <EOS>
<SOS> in this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation <EOS>
<SOS> new insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> surprisingly in this context despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine <EOS>
<SOS> a lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair <EOS>
<SOS> history revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools <EOS>
<SOS> examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair <EOS>
<SOS> this exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools <EOS>
<SOS> a 62 year old female patient presented with bullous intensely itching cutaneous lesions which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis duhring is disease <EOS>
<SOS> therapy with dadps was unsuccessful <EOS>
<SOS> because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly a lymph node biopsy was taken <EOS>
<SOS> histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy aild type t cell lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma <EOS>

<SOS> the purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0 2 t mri unit and a 1 0 t mri unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament <EOS>
<SOS> twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent mri of the knee on both 0 2 t and 1 0 t mri units <EOS>
<SOS> three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament <EOS>
<SOS> frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic <EOS>
<SOS> sixteen of <NUM> patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1 0 t unit the 0 2 t unit detected primary signs in 15 16 93 patients and secondary signs in 7 12 43 patients <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the <NUM> t unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament in these patients the 0 2 t unit detected primary signs in 1 8 cases 12 and secondary signs in 3 8 cases 37 <EOS>
<SOS> observer agreement was very good for the 1 0 t unit and fair for the 0 2 t unit <EOS>
<SOS> there is no substantial difference between 1 0 t units and 0 2 t mri units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament <EOS>
<SOS> in the visualisation of secondary signs 1 0 t units are superior to 0 2 t units and there is a surprisingly high rate of false positive results with the 0 2 t unit <EOS>

<SOS> dependent on the basic illness in question conditions of the bronchoalveolar system vessels lymphatic system and pleura that have developed differently inter and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations <EOS>
<SOS> in the causal pathogenesis the initial auto immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role <EOS>
<SOS> when the monocytes macrophages and fibroblasts are activated as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness e g rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus progressive systemic scleroderma dermatomyositis and polymyositis sjögren syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung therapy induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition <EOS>
<SOS> good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist <EOS>
<SOS> scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes in other words it assesses regional perfusion permeability leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover <EOS>
<SOS> these processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics <EOS>
<SOS> this review 1 describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures 2 suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and 3 addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures <EOS>
<SOS> in summary we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation <EOS>
<SOS> a negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history <EOS>
<SOS> in cases with short clinical histories granulocytic inflammation leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step in chronic processes lymphomonocytic inflammation gallium scintigraphy is advisable <EOS>
<SOS> other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands <EOS>
<SOS> spect is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head spine and large joints <EOS>
<SOS> to assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation <NUM> eyes 51 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma <NUM> eyes with secondary glaucoma <NUM> eyes with narrow angle glaucoma <NUM> eyes with other glaucomas of <NUM> patients were treated <EOS>
<SOS> using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe ending in a focusing tip all eyes were treated with 24 30 spots over <NUM> <NUM> ° and <MOB> j of energy <NUM> mm posterior to the limbus <EOS>
<SOS> the intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8 24 months after operation <EOS>
<SOS> additionally morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in <NUM> eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> our objective was to determine the efficacy of eswl treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone free rate in children after eswl treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we report a 44 year old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures <EOS>
<SOS> histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma <EOS>
<SOS> this tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults <EOS>
<SOS> there is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open <EOS>
<SOS> the decision depends on the given case <EOS>
<SOS> nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue <EOS>
<SOS> cardiopulmonary exercise testing cpx is a non invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise <EOS>
<SOS> determination of oxygen uptake vo2 and carbon dioxide output vco2 describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> an incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders <EOS>
<SOS> at rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters <EOS>
<SOS> during exercise the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse <EOS>
<SOS> our study shows that cpx is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders <EOS>
<SOS> monitoring of ph of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure whereas until now ph monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of <NUM> patients who underwent ph monitoring to determine possible reflux <EOS>
<SOS> since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically further study is required in certain cases <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx <EOS>
<SOS> in such cases 24 h ph monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of gastric laryngitis <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes <EOS>
<SOS> in babies and infants these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia <EOS>
<SOS> viral infections and or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults adult giant cell hepatitis agch which is much rarer <EOS>
<SOS> in some of the cases there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses <EOS>
<SOS> giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of hiv infection <EOS>
<SOS> these both indicate an infectious cause <EOS>
<SOS> however the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees <EOS>
<SOS> apart from our case only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis a infection could be demonstrated serologically <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient <EOS>
<SOS> this autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient especially since a hepatitis a infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with a significant elongation of the acl we propose a new therapeutic regimen <EOS>
<SOS> after mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the acl we pull the bone block with the attached acl distally <EOS>
<SOS> thus the acl is easily tightened <EOS>
<SOS> in accordance with this method we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the acl the tibial insertion is mobilised the bone block with the attached acl removed from the joint <EOS>
<SOS> ex vivo sutures are placed into the acl the ligament is pulled back into the joint and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block <EOS>
<SOS> purpose one aspect of biocompatibility of iols can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo <EOS>
<SOS> background the paper focuses on the issues how couples cope with sids and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children self help and professional support <EOS>
<SOS> methods in a retrospective study <NUM> couples members of a self help organization were studied at the average of <NUM> years <MOB> months after their loss <EOS>
<SOS> depression anxiety physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires <EOS>
<SOS> a community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls <EOS>
<SOS> results average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample <EOS>
<SOS> men and women coped differently with the loss bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers <EOS>
<SOS> they expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the self help group serves an important function as a coping resource the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families <EOS>
<SOS> a 63 year old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine <EOS>
<SOS> this reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema <EOS>
<SOS> we discuss the signs and symptoms pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine induced livedo reticularis <EOS>
<SOS> despite the diagnostic criteria of the icd 10 and dsm iv the term borderline has been used in a non specific way for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> for our investigation we constructed a questionnaire which contained the icd 10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder bpd plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder <EOS>
<SOS> the two additional criteria for the bpd used by the dsm iv were added <EOS>
<SOS> 800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria which they thought were typical for the bpd <EOS>
<SOS> by using the operational diagnostic approach for icd 10 and dsm iv a disorder was diagnosed from each of the <NUM> received questionnaires based on the marked criteria <EOS>
<SOS> 92 0 of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the bpd by icd 10 and 96 3 by dsm iv <EOS>
<SOS> in addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> this is a sign for the difficulty to separate the bpd from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype <NUM> disorder by using operationalised criteria <EOS>
<SOS> looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality <NUM> disorders e g <EOS>
<SOS> for the bpd which has been discussed by many authors for years modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered <EOS>
<SOS> neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self injurious behavior <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned <EOS>
<SOS> opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self injurious behaviour in mentally retardation <EOS>
<SOS> we report about <NUM> mentally retarded patients which were given open label riperidone for <NUM> <URL> participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule das <EOS>
<SOS> purpose to test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy vcb in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions <EOS>
<SOS> materials and methods <NUM> patients 131 lesions were examined using vcb with 14g or 11g vacuum core <EOS>
<SOS> radiologic information systems ris and picture archiving and communication systems pacs are becoming increasingly widespread <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to new demands on the integration of the individual formerly independent information systems ris modalities pacs <EOS>
<SOS> possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced <EOS>
<SOS> besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication its role in the pacs at the university hospital in freiburg is explained <EOS>
<SOS> the integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces <EOS>
<SOS> an appropriate integration generally has been realized in freiburg <EOS>
<SOS> in the near future dicom basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible <EOS>
<SOS> even though an available communication standard exists not all problems in the ris modality interface are solved <EOS>
<SOS> different data models in the various ri systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard <EOS>
<SOS> thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard <EOS>
<SOS> background denecke developed <NUM> a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of ixth and xth cranial nerve <EOS>
<SOS> these four steps are the following myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative <EOS>
<SOS> reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient <EOS>
<SOS> methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem <EOS>
<SOS> our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba <EOS>
<SOS> reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials the largest series being presented from sweden <EOS>
<SOS> mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of <NUM> in women ages 50 59 years <EOS>
<SOS> in younger women <MOB> years the benefit accounts to only <NUM> and has not proven to be statistically significant <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non palpable tumor <NUM> mm in size <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long term survival rates of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the usa canada iceland and sweden for women in their 5th decade of life <EOS>
<SOS> starting yearly lifelong mammography screening at the age of 40 the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> under highly qualified conditions it should be possible to minimize false positive and false negative screening results <EOS>
<SOS> in germany screening mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> based on medical data mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk starting at the age of 40 although there are still open questions needing further clinical research <EOS>
<SOS> upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights <EOS>
<SOS> however the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well tolerated platinum implants <EOS>
<SOS> methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research <EOS>
<SOS> so far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature which reduces the comparability of results from different authors <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows german industrial standards din <NUM> 455 <EOS>
<SOS> the experimental set up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps <EOS>
<SOS> the dumbbell shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested <EOS>
<SOS> well known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set up <EOS>
<SOS> reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds n 120 was possible <EOS>
<SOS> we recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system <EOS>
<SOS> with the increasing numbers of hiv infections some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with hiv and arterial aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> however complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare <EOS>
<SOS> partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance <EOS>
<SOS> it may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation <EOS>
<SOS> although this is well established nasogastric tubes are commonly used because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure <EOS>
<SOS> a new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in <NUM> preterm and term infants over a <NUM> weeks period <EOS>
<SOS> there was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in <NUM> patients and only <NUM> patiend aged <NUM> weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of a <NUM> days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86 2 for all patients and 92 5 for patients below <NUM> weeks of age <EOS>
<SOS> mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft tissue neoplasms in adults <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years a number of new entities and variants have been described <EOS>
<SOS> their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy <EOS>
<SOS> chondroid lipoma myolipoma and purely cutaneous spindle cell pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically <EOS>
<SOS> despite high grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour well differentiated liposarcoma and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma <EOS>
<SOS> the advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes <EOS>
<SOS> the intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium <EOS>
<SOS> the hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure <EOS>
<SOS> we report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure icp and failure of conservative icp treatment <EOS>
<SOS> all four patients had survived a severe neurological disease encephalitis subdural haematoma stroke which required craniectomy to control raised icp <EOS>
<SOS> all were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and ct scans showed no space occupying lesion anymore <EOS>
<SOS> the patients showed a typical sunken pattern at the trepanation site <EOS>
<SOS> all patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation i e <EOS>
<SOS> unilateral dilated pupils deteriorated alertness and extensor posturing shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture <EOS>
<SOS> one patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical <NUM> ° upright position <EOS>
<SOS> after craniectomy transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased icp <EOS>
<SOS> it is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure which is enhanced by changes in the csf compartment following lumbar puncture <EOS>
<SOS> lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and when necessary only be performed in the head down position <EOS>
<SOS> acute therapy in these cases is quite simple it requires flat or even head down positioning and early cranioplasty <EOS>
<SOS> diseases of the oral cavity floor of the mouth and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing <EOS>
<SOS> these disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion <EOS>
<SOS> it was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer assisted quantitative analysis procedure <EOS>
<SOS> video sequences of <NUM> healthy adults and <NUM> patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> a numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged bolus air muscles of the tongue floor of the mouth hyoid etc <EOS>
<SOS> intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves <EOS>
<SOS> the healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves <EOS>
<SOS> these maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue <EOS>
<SOS> patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography <EOS>
<SOS> these appeared as local or general reductions in movement slow speed motions repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing <EOS>
<SOS> clinically used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers s and r ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of s ketamine to be three times higher than that of r ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> it was the aim of this study to compare the effects of s ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters recovery and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia tiva for orthopaedic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> forty patients over <NUM> years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double blind randomised design <EOS>
<SOS> for induction of tiva patients received <NUM> mg midazolam <NUM> mg atropine <NUM> mg kg s ketamine or <NUM> mg kg racemic ketamine respectively <NUM> mg vecuronium and <NUM> mg kg suxamethonium <EOS>
<SOS> after intubation and relaxation with a total dose of <NUM> mg kg vecuronium a continuous infusion of <NUM> mg kg per hour s or <NUM> mg kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery <EOS>
<SOS> blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time points before induction as well during and after surgery until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline noradrenaline by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection anti diuretic hormone adh adrenocorticotropic hormone acth cortisol by radioimmunoassay glucose and lactate <EOS>
<SOS> in addition systolic arterial pressure sap heart rate hr and arterial oxygen saturation were measured and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients <EOS>
<SOS> biometric data of the groups were comparable the mean age of both groups being <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> plasma adrenaline noradrenaline adh acth cortisol and glucose as well as sap and hr increased significantly p0 05 during the course of anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the influence on lactate levels was not significant <EOS>
<SOS> there were no differences between s and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters <EOS>
<SOS> three patients in the ketamine racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study <EOS>
<SOS> recovery clearly improved after administration of s ketamine compared to the racemate <EOS>
<SOS> simple orders were followed after <NUM> <NUM> versus <NUM> <NUM> min p 0 07 orientation with respect to person returned after <NUM> <NUM> versus <NUM> <NUM> min p0 001 and spatial orientation after <NUM> <NUM> versus <NUM> <NUM> min p0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> after racemic ketamine <NUM> patient remembered a negative dream and <NUM> patient a positive dream <EOS>
<SOS> in the s group <NUM> positive dream was reported <EOS>
<SOS> no intraoperative awareness was reported and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again <EOS>
<SOS> increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to adh acth and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during tiva with ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and s ketamine were comparable <EOS>
<SOS> because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load s ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> the closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying if a free transplant is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> following the technique of tillmann described first in 1908 several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> patients ages 41 88 years where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors 5 melanomas <NUM> basal cell carcinomas <NUM> keratoacanthoma <NUM> trichilemmal cyst <NUM> squamous cell carcinoma <NUM> skin metastasis were successfully closed by this method <EOS>
<SOS> the diameter of the defect ranged between <NUM> and <NUM> cm mean 5 7 cm <EOS>
<SOS> size and number of the rotating flaps 3 or 4 was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> wound healing occurred without complications except in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> 2 patients 63 years <NUM> years developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps <EOS>
<SOS> in a <NUM> year old man with a very large defect of <NUM> cm diameter one flap of four underwent total necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> the cosmetic result was rated very good in 71 4 and good in 14 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage <EOS>
<SOS> the windmill procedure is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp particularly in young patients <EOS>
<SOS> intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels <EOS>
<SOS> despite systematic diagnostics distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult <EOS>
<SOS> we report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery <EOS>
<SOS> the operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy however intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed <EOS>
<SOS> a solitary right lung metastasis was resected <NUM> months later using stapling devices <EOS>
<SOS> complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures <EOS>
<SOS> since thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> a rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> cases are reported in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> we treated a 20 year old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies one operation and one mri finally phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed <EOS>
<SOS> twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft <EOS>
<SOS> hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages 1 stigmatization of the patient 2 the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion 3 in many patients the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect 4 acoustic feedback when amplification is high <EOS>
<SOS> conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone <EOS>
<SOS> sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission <EOS>
<SOS> this along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations <EOS>
<SOS> an implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid <EOS>
<SOS> the hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air <EOS>
<SOS> this implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane the ossicular chain the perilymph of the inner ear or the skull <EOS>
<SOS> corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines <EOS>
<SOS> as the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions we investigated the effect of endotoxin from e coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density <EOS>
<SOS> for the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss snhl many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> for these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed allowing distortion free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids <EOS>
<SOS> the external parts of partial implants however may result in a patient is stigmatization <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal <EOS>
<SOS> recently we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of snhl hno <NUM> 1998 <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> here we report the first implantations of this unique totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with snhl implex tica lz <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum <EOS>
<SOS> the signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear <EOS>
<SOS> a piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions <EOS>
<SOS> energy is provided by an implantable battery <EOS>
<SOS> implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion free and transparent <EOS>
<SOS> speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved <EOS>
<SOS> patients may achieve better speech discrimination especially in the presence of background noise <EOS>
<SOS> the aid can be used during sports including swimming <EOS>
<SOS> to our knowledge this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients <EOS>
<SOS> these results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study <EOS>
<SOS> catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy rf is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with ventricular tachycardia vt the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> in the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification <EOS>
<SOS> we find out that the two terms are very similar <EOS>
<SOS> they include the keys for diagnosis and therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we propose a method to construct new coding systems <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we report about the existing coding systems in orthopaedics and traumatology <EOS>
<SOS> we cite a list of national and international coding systems <EOS>
<SOS> because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term indikationsspezifische komplikation which is of importance since the 5 <EOS>

<SOS> resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89 year old male patient led to the diagnosis unusual at this age of an inflammatory pseudotumor synonym plasma cell granuloma of the retroperitoneum and mesentery which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node <EOS>
<SOS> histology and immunohistochemistry demonstrating a myofibroblastic phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and polyclonality of abundantly present plasma cells of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled <EOS>
<SOS> the recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> an example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour pft is presented for the first time in the german language literature <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic criteria for this rare soft tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur include the plexiform structure which gives it its name extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast like giant cells <EOS>
<SOS> the development of the tumour described here which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised <NUM> years previously indicates the possibility of induction of pft by radiation <EOS>
<SOS> the current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system <EOS>
<SOS> two examples have been selected the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients <EOS>
<SOS> study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time including scene time is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable <EOS>
<SOS> it has however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20 of the total scene time thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time <EOS>
<SOS> correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries <EOS>
<SOS> small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed <EOS>
<SOS> endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious <EOS>
<SOS> the importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> the common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation have been widely investigated <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless various aspects of their application are still controversial <EOS>
<SOS> the most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression <EOS>
<SOS> new methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation such as acd cpr or vest cpr have shown promising results in animal experiments <EOS>
<SOS> however the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> it has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival <EOS>
<SOS> the present generation of defibrillators has been further improved particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms which may reduce the required energy as well as possible complications while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size <EOS>
<SOS> scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts but in particular for their application under quality control conditions <EOS>
<SOS> politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete experimental models experimental design <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the german research fund <EOS>
<SOS> however in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings <EOS>
<SOS> cross sectional imaging modalities including sonography ct and mri have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers <EOS>
<SOS> their staging criteria are based on the well established figo staging system <EOS>
<SOS> ct and mri compete with sonography which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis <EOS>
<SOS> this paper reviews the role of sonography ct and mri in the staging of gynecologic malignancies <EOS>
<SOS> it puts the emphasis on mri which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer and which seems slightly superior to ct in the staging of ovarian cancer <EOS>
<SOS> extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses <EOS>
<SOS> these aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration with a recurrence rate of about <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> trauma hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors <EOS>
<SOS> shoulder chest wall back and thigh are favored sites <EOS>
<SOS> by combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few <EOS>
<SOS> while in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important <EOS>
<SOS> amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly <EOS>
<SOS> katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis <EOS>
<SOS> we report on an eleven year old boy who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to malawi <EOS>
<SOS> remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma antigens <EOS>
<SOS> six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of schistosoma haematobium in the urine <EOS>
<SOS> parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative <EOS>
<SOS> there is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in germany today <EOS>
<SOS> most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated <EOS>
<SOS> the main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years <EOS>
<SOS> the definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors <EOS>
<SOS> it is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice <EOS>
<SOS> only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail as discussed in this article <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the use of somato sensory evoked potentials sep in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted <EOS>
<SOS> however reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic sep alterations differ widely <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study we registered sep alterations during <NUM> operations done on <NUM> patients between <NUM> july 1994 and <NUM> december <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> incidence risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> in only 1 7 of cases sep examination was inadequate <EOS>
<SOS> during <NUM> operations sep were altered minimally or not at all <EOS>
<SOS> significant changes were dedected during <NUM> interventions 13 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection five events three deficits <EOS>
<SOS> cross clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations 81 5 they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance <EOS>
<SOS> as risk factor for cross clamping ischaemia only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified <EOS>
<SOS> tyrosine rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from black african patients <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed <EOS>
<SOS> millon is staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case report of a 59 year old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by k wires <EOS>
<SOS> however delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless <EOS>
<SOS> to prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary 4 day x ray control displaced fractures of the radial condyle i e those with a central gap of more than <NUM> mm were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> sixty six patients 41 boys <NUM> girls with an average follow up of <NUM> years 2 22 years sustained <NUM> primary and <NUM> secondary displaced fractures <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases a k wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment <EOS>
<SOS> two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow <EOS>
<SOS> screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in <NUM> of <NUM> children probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3 4 weeks <EOS>
<SOS> however fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only <EOS>
<SOS> a commercially available c1 inhibitor c1 inh concentrate was used for short term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema <EOS>
<SOS> the patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face extremities and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary c1 inh deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long term prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia with mask ventilation or intubation <EOS>
<SOS> the c1 inh plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low <MOB> g l normal range <MOB> g l despite the oral long term prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> substitution treatment with <MOB> u c1 inh was performed <NUM> h before surgery <EOS>
<SOS> no side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions <EOS>
<SOS> with this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case <EOS>
<SOS> the measurement of c1 inh plasma concentration <NUM> h or <NUM> h after c1 inh substitution showed a marked rise in both patients though normal values were not reached in either <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest that infusion of c1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness <EOS>
<SOS> this case report describes a <NUM> years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> she underwent cox maze ii procedure during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm <EOS>
<SOS> transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued <EOS>
<SOS> two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported <NUM> an 11 year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress <EOS>
<SOS> in upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan and in this case splenopexy was performed <EOS>
<SOS> an otherwise healthy 3 year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside down spleen with partial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and ct scan <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography <EOS>
<SOS> after partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed <EOS>
<SOS> discussion in situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of chronic back pain in particular there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient is subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so called degenerative changes <EOS>
<SOS> back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings <EOS>
<SOS> despite the wealth of empirical evidence it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment <EOS>
<SOS> the decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor is reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness <EOS>
<SOS> if this situation is to change an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice <EOS>
<SOS> the laboratory surveillance of measles in germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation <EOS>
<SOS> compared to data of the pre vaccination era the incidence of measles has been reduced while a shift in age towards the group of 15 year olds is observed <EOS>
<SOS> germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the european region by the year <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot <EOS>
<SOS> in order to effectively control measles high vaccination rates of at least 90 are necessary by the end of the second year of life <EOS>
<SOS> in addition laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination <EOS>
<SOS> main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses <EOS>
<SOS> the working group measles arbeitsgemeinschaft masern agm as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in germany <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the activities of the national reference centre for measles mumps and rubella since <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the german data are compared to those of selected other european countries <EOS>
<SOS> the different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of brittle nails and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared <EOS>
<SOS> at this time measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails <EOS>
<SOS> reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described <EOS>
<SOS> this combination of injuries is rather rare and only <NUM> cases were found in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule <EOS>
<SOS> immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result <EOS>
<SOS> the management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently <EOS>
<SOS> surgeons education preclinical rescue structures initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies as well as diagnostic imaging have progressed <EOS>
<SOS> plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of ct fast imaging techniques spiral ct have led to the inclusion of ct in the primary survey <EOS>

<SOS> basics state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist is point of view <EOS>
<SOS> the importance of hepatitis c virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy <EOS>
<SOS> in a collaborative research project of the committees for the study of idiopathic cardiomyopathy hepatitis c virus antibody was found in <NUM> of <NUM> patients <URL> with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in <NUM> of <NUM> patients 6 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in japan <EOS>
<SOS> hepatitis c virus antibody was detected in <NUM> of 11 967 patients 5 4 seeking care in <NUM> academic hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> various cardiac abnormalities were found and arrhythmias were the most frequent <EOS>
<SOS> these observations suggest that hepatitis c virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases <EOS>
<SOS> transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells rpe display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment <EOS>
<SOS> this study determines the activity of contraction promoting factors examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors <EOS>
<SOS> using an in vitro contractionassay we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells is effectively stimulated by serum platelet derived growth factor and insulin like growth factor 1 <EOS>
<SOS> endothelin 1 and transforming growth factor 1 and 2 have a more discrete or marginal effect <EOS>
<SOS> tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent <EOS>
<SOS> contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis suggesting different active factors and or pathways <EOS>
<SOS> staurosporine a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells regardless of the promoter <EOS>
<SOS> revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto iliac vascular reconstructions particular in high risk patients poses a therapeutic dilemma <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 78 year old female patient who presented after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries with leriche syndrome resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease <EOS>
<SOS> due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo bifemoral ptfe graft <EOS>
<SOS> the preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid subclavian bypass on the left <EOS>
<SOS> this stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo bifemoral graft which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative angiography verified a good run off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained <EOS>
<SOS> duplex sonography <NUM> months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> these results demonstrate that combined with intraoperative stent application an axillo bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results <EOS>
<SOS> objective concerning the long term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and or born very premature there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements <EOS>
<SOS> a follow up study was carried out on premature born children from thuringia and saxonia at pre school and early school age in order to investigate the long term somatic development of these children <EOS>
<SOS> anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group <EOS>
<SOS> mediastinitis caused by infection with clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38 year old woman <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> the lack of information regarding emesis the leading symptom of boerhaave is syndrome caused delayed diagnosis the triad of emesis severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until <NUM> h after the onset of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> for ethical and socio economical reasons cost explosion in transfusion medicine patient is individual destiny devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal lenge to anesthesiologists surgeons and blood bankers <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of different techniques i e <EOS>
<SOS> autologous predonation hemodilution choice of anesthetic regimen deliberate hypotension application of anti fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> introduction if the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> different procedures are recommended reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place recession of the inferior oblique muscle and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye <EOS>
<SOS> no quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> children 87 children belonging to a control group <NUM> with fever of non renal origin and <NUM> with pyelonephritis albumin and immunoglobulin g markers for glomerular dysfunction 1 microglobulin and <NUM> nag markers for proximal tubular dysfunction and apolipoprotein a1 marker of postrenal dysfunction were measured in second voided morning urine <EOS>
<SOS> in children with fever of non renal origin glomerular dysfunction was encountered in <NUM> tubular dysfunction in <NUM> and mixed glomerular tubular dysfunction in <NUM> of cases <EOS>
<SOS> among children with pyelonephritis <NUM> revealed glomerular dysfunction and <NUM> mixed glomerular tubular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> no case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis <EOS>
<SOS> there were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non renal origin and children with pyelonephritis p <MOB> whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction the differences were only moderately significant nag p 0 01 or of low significance 1 microglobulin p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> this may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli resulting in glomerular dysfunction while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever associated function processes <EOS>
<SOS> up to the middle of the 1970s chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today <EOS>
<SOS> there are indications for chemotherapy which can theoretically be used as follows <EOS>
<SOS> we compared a cw carbon dioxide flash scanning laser system to an er yag laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides <EOS>

<SOS> a separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique <EOS>
<SOS> this can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube <EOS>
<SOS> diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> this can lead to life threatening situations <EOS>
<SOS> we observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems <EOS>
<SOS> this is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully <EOS>
<SOS> a too high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation <EOS>
<SOS> the tubes should never be processed more than <NUM> times <EOS>
<SOS> routine examination of the tubes is imperative especially at the predilection sites for layer separation <EOS>
<SOS> severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in <NUM> adults 4 of entire population operated for coarctation <EOS>

<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> experienced addiction therapists provid ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of <NUM> clients 26 women and <NUM> men with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse <EOS>
<SOS> 42 had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men <EOS>
<SOS> the victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption <EOS>
<SOS> 26 of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post traumatic stress disorder <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with individuals without trauma experiences victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types <EOS>
<SOS> there may be an acute type i allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions in rare cases with lethal outcome <EOS>
<SOS> routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value in spite of the high frequency of so called risk factors atopy other kind of allergy among the evaluated group of patients <EOS>
<SOS> careful allergological testing should be performed <NUM> to <NUM> weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance in order to discover the underlying causative agent <EOS>
<SOS> skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics <EOS>
<SOS> rast and ria tests and or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally <EOS>
<SOS> together with all other administered drugs all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers suxamethonium vecuronium pancuronium alcuronium atracurium mivacurium should be tested since they often represent the cause for such reactions <EOS>
<SOS> for other classes of drugs for example volatile anesthetics and opioids the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain <EOS>
<SOS> for less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus or exanthems skin testing seems to be less relevant <EOS>
<SOS> nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage <EOS>
<SOS> human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away <EOS>
<SOS> they learn by pain to avoid these situations in future <EOS>
<SOS> shortly after major injury there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger later on emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation <EOS>
<SOS> while acute pain has a certain meaning chronic pain does not <EOS>
<SOS> it induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative appetite and vigilance <EOS>
<SOS> it reduces life quality often accompanied by depressive moods <EOS>
<SOS> acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception hyperalgesia <EOS>
<SOS> during healing the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks <EOS>
<SOS> sometimes unknown factors initiate chronification of pain <EOS>
<SOS> changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce cellular early genes 24 a synthesis of c fos c jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain <EOS>
<SOS> all efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development <EOS>
<SOS> one of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique incision extension limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible <EOS>
<SOS> however nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing <EOS>
<SOS> pain induces a reduction of ventilation circulation digestion and increases the risk of other disorders <EOS>
<SOS> there is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function 10 <EOS>
<SOS> this is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy srd <EOS>
<SOS> antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome 2 12 <EOS>
<SOS> hence regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients <EOS>
<SOS> good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today <EOS>
<SOS> anand 1 demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in <NUM> newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery when general anaesthesia was performed with high dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine <EOS>

<SOS> in diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large scale procedures available <EOS>
<SOS> refering to a three step scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in i non invasive ii <EOS>
<SOS> invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained <EOS>
<SOS> to the non invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics the physical examination and laboratory screenings <EOS>
<SOS> the semi invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography the corpus cavernosum electromyogram cc emg and other neurophysiological examinations <EOS>
<SOS> the third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry dicc and the selective pharmacological phallo arteriography <EOS>
<SOS> the procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions <EOS>
<SOS> technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the international workshop on embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer strategies organized at the gene center munich september <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding <EOS>
<SOS> biology of embryonic stem cells nuclear transfer strategies and stem cell differentiation cell therapy were the main topics of the meeting <EOS>
<SOS> it became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes <EOS>
<SOS> however data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future <EOS>
<SOS> before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture i e identification of differentiation factors selective differentiation strategies reporter gene assays is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei <EOS>
<SOS> certain fractures and or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post traumatic osteonecrosis <EOS>
<SOS> however the more complex etiology of non traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy radiotherapy thermal injuries and especially coagulopathies which are now commonly observed in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t pa and pai 1 expression from human endothelial cells <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose we cultured human endothelium cells gained from umbilical veins for <NUM> h with sera of <NUM> patients with hellp syndrome and <NUM> patients with preeclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> the sera of <NUM> normotensive pregnant patients and <NUM> non pregnant women were used as controls <EOS>
<SOS> we then determined t pa and pai 1 levels by elisa both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures <EOS>
<SOS> while t pa levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and hellp syndrome than in the control group median <NUM> ng ml and <NUM> ng ml vs <NUM> ng ml and <NUM> ng ml levels of pai 1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups <EOS>
<SOS> the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t pa p0 001 and pai 1 p0 01 when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or hellp syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the increased expression of t pa and pai 1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics <EOS>
<SOS> on demand analgesia using a pca patient controlled analgesia system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> while pca devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses <EOS>
<SOS> in a study under double blind conditions <NUM> asa i and ii patients were assigned at random to group i infusion group or group b bolus group when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the patients in group i received an initial intravenous loading dose of <NUM> mg tramadol followed by an infusion of <NUM> mg h tramadol for <NUM> h if necessary repeated boluses of <NUM> mg tramadol were given <EOS>
<SOS> in group b the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion otherwise the procedure was the same <EOS>
<SOS> pain relief was monitored by means of a vas visual analogue scale up to <NUM> h after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after <NUM> h how often repetitive boluses were required and the amount of analgesics administered in <NUM> and <NUM> h results <EOS>
<SOS> the pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76 5 of group i and 65 6 of group b 19 1 of group i and 26 9 of group b assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory 4 4 of group i and 7 5 of group b complained of insufficient analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> in group i 69 2 requested only one or no repetitive bolus compared with 40 3 in group b while two or more boluses were demanded by 30 8 in group i and 59 7 in group b <EOS>
<SOS> the average analgesic consumption after <NUM> h was <NUM> <NUM> mg tramadol in group i and <NUM> <NUM> mg tramadol in group b respectively <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> h it was <NUM> <NUM> mg tramadol in group i and <NUM> <NUM> mg tramadol in group b <EOS>
<SOS> while the consumption during the first <NUM> h was comparable from then on the consumption in group i increased significantly <EOS>
<SOS> side effects were reported by 25 in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> they were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case <EOS>
<SOS> during the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes <EOS>
<SOS> the fact that the patients in group i requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group b and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group <EOS>
<SOS> concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side effects have proven unfounded <EOS>
<SOS> six hours after surgery when analgesia was evaluated by the patients there was no significant difference between the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further <NUM> h was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher <EOS>
<SOS> thus we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion <NUM> h after operation <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of tuberculid was introduced by darier in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to true cutaneous tuberculosis properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection <EOS>
<SOS> key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis and prompt response to antituberculous therapy the inability to culture m tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies together with reports on tuberculid like eruptions after bcg vaccination supports this concept <EOS>
<SOS> clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum papulo necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of bazin <EOS>
<SOS> the existence of tuberculids has been questioned however because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific <EOS>
<SOS> an increasing number of case reports on tuberculids new immunological tests and molecular biology based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept <EOS>
<SOS> case report a 20 year old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax <EOS>
<SOS> a secondary amenorrhea was coexisting <EOS>
<SOS> on the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible <EOS>
<SOS> chest x ray and hr ct showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis x which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk <EOS>
<SOS> conventional consensus treatment for adults with vinblastine prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces <EOS>
<SOS> treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children <EOS>
<SOS> this treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6 mercaptopurine <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor <EOS>
<SOS> the hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70 90 in patients with solid tumors to 75 90 in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95 in patients after bone marrow transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases <EOS>
<SOS> this results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified <EOS>
<SOS> a reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures <EOS>
<SOS> patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present <EOS>
<SOS> for these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered <EOS>
<SOS> intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases <EOS>
<SOS> for other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of a solution oriented marital therapy the different within session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy lineal strategic circular and reflexive as described by tomm 1989 were tested <EOS>
<SOS> in this single case study the method of plan analysis caspar 1989 was used to categorize the client is reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions <EOS>
<SOS> lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system i e <EOS>
<SOS> the client the clients interaction and the therapeutic interaction whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change <EOS>
<SOS> interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change <EOS>
<SOS> for the husband who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change results were not as predicted <EOS>
<SOS> some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed <EOS>
<SOS> prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions <EOS>
<SOS> results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies <EOS>
<SOS> investigations related to emergency medicine are however an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> a retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies <EOS>
<SOS> frequently a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study <EOS>
<SOS> informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies <EOS>
<SOS> however under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness etc <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the following principles should be observed a randomised studies are essential even in emergency medicine b they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group c only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> if the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent the principle of deferred consent is acceptable <EOS>
<SOS> the deferred consent principle should be carefully documented <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation even under emergency conditions <EOS>
<SOS> there are different principles of randomization telephone or telefax randomisation etc <EOS>
<SOS> emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should as a rule not exceed <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> otherwise too many items might change without being noted <EOS>
<SOS> curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees <EOS>
<SOS> if an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee <EOS>
<SOS> if however for example the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement <EOS>
<SOS> in germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions <EOS>
<SOS> for multicentre and multinational studies however the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non german ethics committees <EOS>
<SOS> not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care e g endotracheal intubation etc <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1 3 rating proposed by the american heart association <EOS>
<SOS> in principle the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements <EOS>
<SOS> for all studies particularly in the prehospital setting an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes <EOS>
<SOS> scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens <EOS>
<SOS> biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of ems personnel qualifications etc <EOS>
<SOS> this is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals i e journals with a reasonable rating <EOS>
<SOS> new antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in daily practice the failure rate is 20 30 both with itraconazole and terbinafine <EOS>
<SOS> in our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine we could show that the same strain of trichophyton rubrum or t mentagrophytes in the rest period needs <NUM> times higher concentration of terbinafine 2 0 to 0 002 µg ml for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase <EOS>
<SOS> thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the mic for the fungi they can cause a relapse <EOS>
<SOS> itraconazole is a fungistatic agent <EOS>
<SOS> its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the mic for the causative fungi for a long time <NUM> to <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the usual short term treatment of onychomycosis over <NUM> months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders e g <EOS>
<SOS> circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth <EOS>
<SOS> this paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a 4 out of 7 concept if <NUM> out of <NUM> atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value mode switching ms is automatically performed <EOS>
<SOS> the technical solution in medtronic kappa <NUM> dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations <EOS>
<SOS> the 4 out of 7 algorithm offers a quick ms by the addition of a blanked flutter search algorithm integrated into this concept the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed av intervals <EOS>
<SOS> with the increased rapidity of ms and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats <EOS>
<SOS> therefore to optimize the ms function programming of the device e g activation of a time delay before ms should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> some guidelines are presented in this paper <EOS>
<SOS> finally the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance incidence of atrial arrhythmias and as far as possible confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration <EOS>
<SOS> in order to judge operative success on a long term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow up <EOS>
<SOS> they then completed a questionaire in which they were asked about postoperative complaints <EOS>
<SOS> additionally sinuses were examined by computed tomographic ct and magnetic resonance imaging mr <EOS>
<SOS> among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination <EOS>
<SOS> ct scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> in these patients two thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue <EOS>
<SOS> mr was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus but the mr images failed to correlate with symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> additional results could not be obtained when compared to ct <EOS>
<SOS> overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy slne for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients <EOS>
<SOS> the study presented illustrates the method and our results <EOS>
<SOS> as has been documentated for melanoma the first lymph node sentinel node sln to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph node metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> the database presented includes <NUM> patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases the described method was applicable <EOS>
<SOS> in only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the sln and the axillary specimen <EOS>
<SOS> successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients <EOS>
<SOS> background information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty ltk and for postoperative follow up <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated on acute ltk effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography oct offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> in cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a review of <NUM> left main angioplasties revealed a procedure related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9 1 4 44 in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4 8 1 21 and 0 5 1 187 in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery <EOS>
<SOS> coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery had an unacceptably high procedure related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection <EOS>
<SOS> hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> there are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> in all these patients however cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years <EOS>
<SOS> in addition other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism e g convulsive seizures had been present prior to cardiac symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in this publication nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms etiology and pathogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> the diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out <EOS>
<SOS> clarification of the etiology is still pending <EOS>
<SOS> molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings <EOS>
<SOS> a case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist <EOS>
<SOS> possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> the results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty <EOS>
<SOS> the present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint <EOS>
<SOS> these features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design <EOS>
<SOS> from the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology <EOS>
<SOS> biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i e cylindrical mobility congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise <EOS>
<SOS> the prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone and preferably without cement <EOS>
<SOS> only compressible forces should act at the bone prosthesis interface <EOS>
<SOS> the axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal <EOS>
<SOS> meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities <EOS>
<SOS> restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis primary or traumatic and rheumatoid arthritis <EOS>
<SOS> contraindications are talus necrosis charcot joints extreme osteoporosis severe arteriosclerosis and very aggressive arthritis <EOS>
<SOS> mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities <EOS>
<SOS> the average annual failure rate should not exceed <NUM> if these recommendations are followed <EOS>
<SOS> elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient is chances of regaining bimanual prehension <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore depending on the type of reconstruction stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and or reinnervation different reconstructive procedures are available <EOS>
<SOS> in order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and or ventral upper arm muscles to time the operation appropriately to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients <EOS>
<SOS> our concept is based on our experience with more than <NUM> patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between <NUM> and <NUM> and treated in our institution <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> operative revisions of the brachial plexus <EOS>
<SOS> some <NUM> patients underwent secondary muscle tendon transfers <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer n 10 triceps to biceps transfer n 15 modified flexor pronator muscle mass proximalization n 6 and multiple stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer n 4 <EOS>
<SOS> the official german guidelines for prevention of intravascular device associated infections were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt now called the robert koch institut <NUM> years ago <EOS>
<SOS> the recently published official guidelines for prevention of intravascular device associated infections of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc are categorized according to scientific evidence <EOS>
<SOS> the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical german guidelines <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german speaking anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular device associated infections <EOS>
<SOS> we assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of <NUM> experienced arthroscopists by the kappa cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation <EOS>
<SOS> pathological changes in contrast often showed very little correlation especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament <EOS>
<SOS> in patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation <EOS>
<SOS> clinical relevance when comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures <EOS>
<SOS> in addition medical cost billing which is based on arthroscopic findings has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong <EOS>
<SOS> squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4 of all invasive carcinomas of the breast <EOS>
<SOS> primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare since they occur in less than 1 of all primary invasive breast carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> in order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location <EOS>
<SOS> causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear <EOS>
<SOS> a pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages <EOS>
<SOS> squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role <EOS>
<SOS> the number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> these tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule <EOS>
<SOS> the limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary ptca in acute myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary ptca as compared to thrombolysis <EOS>
<SOS> adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein iia iib inhibitors may further reduce mortality <EOS>
<SOS> for logistic and financial reasons however not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in germany <EOS>
<SOS> primary ptca in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators <EOS>
<SOS> of utmost importance is a reduction of the present onset to opening times by information campaigns an improved triage use of transportation times for pre hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents <EOS>
<SOS> some 245 00 sporting accidents occur yearly in switzerland <EOS>
<SOS> the social accident costs amount to approximately <NUM> billion francs per year <EOS>
<SOS> every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game <EOS>
<SOS> for the shown sporting activities distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children <EOS>
<SOS> as is to be expected the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in line skating <EOS>
<SOS> these new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> the combination of magnetoencephalography meg and magnetic resonance imaging mri allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex <EOS>
<SOS> however this method is technically pretentious and time consuming <EOS>
<SOS> therefore functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol which allows the integration of functional meg data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation as a routine method <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 15 year old girl and her relatives with typical features of ehlers danlos syndrome type vii <EOS>
<SOS> main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin easy bruisability joint hypermobility features suggesting premature aging and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth <EOS>
<SOS> the inheritance of this type of ehlers danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant <EOS>
<SOS> the biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated <EOS>
<SOS> the acute liver failure alf is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver <EOS>
<SOS> despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe alf have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of alf <EOS>
<SOS> numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate <EOS>
<SOS> liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> it is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver is essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion <EOS>
<SOS> over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only <EOS>
<SOS> this article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications <EOS>
<SOS> after a latency period of <NUM> years in a 39 year old austrian citizen of chinese origin a surgically removed rectal carcinoma as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis <EOS>
<SOS> whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial <EOS>
<SOS> the etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large bowel diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in the sequence chronic inflammation severe dysplasia the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur <EOS>
<SOS> besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology the link between rectal carcinoma and schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations <EOS>
<SOS> rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication <EOS>
<SOS> mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> this paper reports on a 51 year old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using v y technique <EOS>
<SOS> on day <NUM> after operation the carotid bulb ruptured <EOS>
<SOS> the suture line was not involved <EOS>
<SOS> the rupture was due to local wall necrosis as verified by histologic examination <EOS>
<SOS> in an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a dacron patch <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial stunning contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion and myocardial hibernation contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion have represented separate concepts of viable but dyssynergic myocardium in the past <EOS>
<SOS> however in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion <EOS>
<SOS> with increasing severity and duration of ischemia degeneration of cardiac myocytes accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue <EOS>
<SOS> additonally there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis which in turn limits functional recovery <EOS>
<SOS> in the light of these structural features the available methods for detection of viable myocardium in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques offer complementary rather than contradictory information <EOS>
<SOS> dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity excellent specificity and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> while in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a <NUM> segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> the complete low and high dose dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response biphasic response new wall motion abnormality which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction <EOS>
<SOS> the test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> if ischemia or viability is documented revascularization should be performed promptly <EOS>
<SOS> a similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive time to revascularization is critical <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta <EOS>
<SOS> the coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart <EOS>
<SOS> the resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end to end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation <EOS>
<SOS> after a vosschulte aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen <EOS>
<SOS> this method however brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> in the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm <NUM> years after a vosschulte aortoplasty <EOS>
<SOS> the aging of the italian population is an emerging public health priority <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over <NUM> years old <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory check plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately <EOS>
<SOS> increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic retrograde choledocho pancreaticography ercp was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus <EOS>
<SOS> it revealed a common channel situation ductus choledochus and pancreaticus and choledocholithiasis <EOS>
<SOS> papillotomy and stone extraction could not remove abdominal pain <EOS>
<SOS> laparatomy and choledocho jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix synthesis of the transplanted cells <EOS>
<SOS> this in turn is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid sf of the respective joint <EOS>
<SOS> we addressed the question whether analysis of a patient is sf can predict the rate of matrix synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this sf in vitro <EOS>
<SOS> sf was obtained from <NUM> patients with disorders of the knee including gonarthrosis n 44 meniscal tears n 10 rheumatoid arthritis n 53 and reactive arthritides n 8 <EOS>
<SOS> in the sf the following parameters were determined interleukin 1 il 6 il 8 il 1 ra tnf insulin like growth factor i igf i igf ii igf binding protein 2 igfbp 2 igfbp 3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity <EOS>
<SOS> to assess the effect of sf on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of sf and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases a monoclonal antibody directed against igf i was added <EOS>
<SOS> sf from patients with oa or trauma respectively stimulated pg synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did sf from patients with rheumatic arthritides <EOS>
<SOS> on the average <NUM> percent of the sf induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti igf i ab <EOS>
<SOS> the best predictor for the sf effects on pg synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free igf i r 0 573 p 0 001 spearman rank correlation followed by the sf concentrations of igf i with a positive sign igfbp 3 il 1 and tnf all with a negative sign <EOS>
<SOS> according to our data igf i is the most important anabolic factor in human sf with respect to cartilage pg synthesis <EOS>
<SOS> the proportion of free igf i seems to be of special importance in this regard <EOS>
<SOS> low sf levels of free igf i could be identified as a possible risk factor for a sub optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu <EOS>
<SOS> the coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> however only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia <EOS>
<SOS> this may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to icd 10 <EOS>
<SOS> the productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy <EOS>
<SOS> although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> a 54 year old female patient with a 10 year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported <EOS>
<SOS> transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of <NUM> did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> after many years with only occasional disturbances a distinct organic brain syndrome developed <EOS>
<SOS> thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis this was based on the history liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in ct <EOS>
<SOS> despite the initiation of specific therapy the patient died of the sequelae of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> at autopsy characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts <EOS>
<SOS> additional intracerebral mesenchymal glial reactions were less conspicuous <EOS>
<SOS> residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> death was due to cachexia bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the disease has become rare in our country but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children <EOS>
<SOS> all neonates born in the department of gynecology and obstetrics university of kiel were included <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> <NUM> 0 98 permil liveborn neonates birth weight <MOB> g 26 41 weeks of gestation the initial hemoglobin level was below <NUM> g dl <EOS>
<SOS> in those children with birth weight below <NUM> g the incidence was <NUM> permil <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> cases the cause of anemia could be clarified <EOS>
<SOS> in five preterm babies 28 an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases there was rh incompatibility in two cases placental bleeding and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia <EOS>
<SOS> in one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause <EOS>
<SOS> another child suffered from ebv infection and one had trisomy <NUM> with multiple malformations <EOS>
<SOS> ten children 55 had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock <EOS>
<SOS> fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically <EOS>
<SOS> seven children 39 six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13 died between days <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth <EOS>
<SOS> six children 33 showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged five of these were resuscitated previously <EOS>
<SOS> five children 28 including three full term babies were developed normally <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion severe anemia with hemoglobin below <NUM> g dl is very rare but serious <EOS>
<SOS> it seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis can be influenced in a positive way <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis of bacterial infection and or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> white blood count c reactive protein crp and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus sirs systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to noninfectious causes <EOS>
<SOS> there is a number of non infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and crp elevation <EOS>
<SOS> in the last <NUM> years procalcitonin pct was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection especially sepsis <EOS>
<SOS> pct appears to have several advantages it is of non hepatic yet unknown origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency <EOS>
<SOS> there is no pct increase in acute graft rejection viral disease and autoimmune disorders <EOS>
<SOS> some studys showed a prognostic value of pct in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis <EOS>
<SOS> pct appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> further studies are needed to finally established pct in the daily management of critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> at this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study the meniscal status of <NUM> patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament acl tears is reported <EOS>
<SOS> the acl injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing <EOS>
<SOS> the mean follow up was <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> twenty nine 65 patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of <NUM> years after the acl injury during the follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears <EOS>
<SOS> the most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket handle type followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn <EOS>
<SOS> secondary reconstruction of the acl was necessary in <NUM> patients complaining of the meniscus giving way <EOS>
<SOS> the remaining five patients had rearthroscopy <NUM> years after the acl injury and a partial meniscectomy and acl reconstruction was performed <EOS>
<SOS> sixteen patients 35 of the overall sample had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow up period but discontinued their sporting activities <EOS>
<SOS> results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during acl insufficiency <EOS>
<SOS> we recommend that patients with ruptures of the acl should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> four children <NUM> to <NUM> years old with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin a csa starting dosage <NUM> mg kg per day and prednisolone <EOS>
<SOS> all children had previously received systemic steroids and or cytotoxic agents which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects <EOS>
<SOS> in one child suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> in a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage <EOS>
<SOS> in the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> during the time of treatment ranging from <NUM> to <NUM> months no serious side effects were observed <EOS>
<SOS> all patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia <EOS>
<SOS> in our d experience cyclosporin a csa combined with low dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments <EOS>
<SOS> while in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts cinnebar and cadmium sulphide now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions <EOS>
<SOS> a 42 year old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos <EOS>
<SOS> histologically a chronic granulomatous partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found <EOS>
<SOS> spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin <EOS>
<SOS> the pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye the patient also showed a positive patch test to napthol as used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry <EOS>
<SOS> borrelia burgdorferi specific dna has been detected by polymerase chain reaction pcr in different specimens of patients with lyme disease ld <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study is to evaluate pcr diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of lyme disease <EOS>
<SOS> urine specimens of <NUM> patients <NUM> ld n 34 undifferentiated arthritis ua n 25 arthralgia myalgia am n 18 and <NUM> controls were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> flagellin gene <NUM> 60 specimens or ospa plasmid <NUM> 32 specimens were used as targets <EOS>
<SOS> sensitivity of the flagellin nested pcr was 27 by ospa nested pcr only one positive pcr result was found <EOS>
<SOS> despite of low sensitivity pcr enabled the correct diagnosis of ld in two patients classified as ua <EOS>
<SOS> therefore pcr can give valuable hints in single cases if ld is clinically suspected <EOS>
<SOS> objective to assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> methods willow bark extract in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin day was compared to placebo in a 2 week double blind randomized controlled trial <EOS>
<SOS> the primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the womac osteoarthritis index <EOS>
<SOS> secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the womac daily visual analogue scales vas on pain and physical function and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators <EOS>
<SOS> results <NUM> patients 39 willow bark extract <NUM> placebo participated in the trial <EOS>
<SOS> a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the womac pain dimension d 6 5mm <URL> p 0 047 the womac pain score was reduced by 14 from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment compared to an increase of 2 in the placebo group <EOS>
<SOS> patient diary vas confirmed this result and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo patients assessment p <MOB> investigators assessment p <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> background and methods the aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians <EOS>
<SOS> 900 patients of five different specialists general medicine internal medicine neurology orthopaedics surgery in the german town bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain <EOS>
<SOS> chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months <EOS>
<SOS> confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> recently new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope <EOS>
<SOS> common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus tonic body extension automatisms vocalizations eye deviations and hallucinations <EOS>
<SOS> thus it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures <EOS>
<SOS> other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors premonitory symptoms and postictal events such as tongue bites and postictal confusion which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions <EOS>
<SOS> investigations such as electroencephalogram tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation <EOS>
<SOS> in rare cases hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack <EOS>
<SOS> in the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell <EOS>
<SOS> in the beginning these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation <EOS>
<SOS> a series of important discoveries initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies <EOS>
<SOS> in surgical oncology these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences <EOS>
<SOS> basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the compartment syndrome cs is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space <EOS>
<SOS> pathophysiologically it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors <EOS>
<SOS> cofactors are for instance the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs <EOS>
<SOS> in particular the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction development of a capillary leak protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space <EOS>
<SOS> an impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction <EOS>
<SOS> an arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure <EOS>
<SOS> an accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load <EOS>
<SOS> in disadvantageous cases the patients are in danger of developing a multi organ deficiency syndrome mods by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction <EOS>
<SOS> clinically the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain followed by neurological signs <EOS>
<SOS> especially in noncompliant patients tissue pressure measurement is useful <EOS>
<SOS> resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important <EOS>
<SOS> in case of a manifest cs dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation <EOS>
<SOS> even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case <EOS>
<SOS> the object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid term and long term follow up <EOS>
<SOS> during the period from january <NUM> to june <NUM> we performed <NUM> open technique <NUM> according to eden hybbinette lange <NUM> according to weber <NUM> according to putti platt <NUM> according to bankart and <NUM> arthroscopic transglenoidal morgan technique shoulder stabilization procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the mean follow up for techniques was eden hybbinette lange <NUM> years <MOB> years weber <NUM> years <MOB> years putti platt <NUM> years <MOB> years bankart <NUM> years <MOB> years and morgan <NUM> years <MOB> years <EOS>
<SOS> we observed that the classic open bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation range of motion sports activity and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the results shows that nonanatomical reconstructive open procedures are not up to date <EOS>
<SOS> the open bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only <EOS>
<SOS> the classic open bankart procedure seems to be the gold standard in open shoulder surgery today <EOS>
<SOS> the high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future <EOS>
<SOS> background our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2 lignocaine and 0 5 plain bupivacaine <EOS>
<SOS> hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance <EOS>
<SOS> when hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest <EOS>
<SOS> usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia <EOS>
<SOS> increasing age diabetes mellitus disorders of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system high dose antibiotics and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia <EOS>
<SOS> the most important pathogenetic mechanisms are 1 renal insufficiency 2 hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism 3 tubular disorders and 4 cellular disorders <EOS>
<SOS> background cmv retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in aids patients with a t helper cell count 50 µl <EOS>
<SOS> cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half life time after phosphorylation intracellularly <EOS>
<SOS> it is effective against cmv and can be given intravenously and intravitreally <EOS>
<SOS> the aim was to offer an alternative therapy for cmv retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> a case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported <EOS>
<SOS> one of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland <EOS>
<SOS> the relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease <EOS>
<SOS> the initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered <EOS>
<SOS> antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection <EOS>
<SOS> frequent problems arising in this condition are 1 the non observation of listerial infections 2 the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis 3 the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections 4 the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy 5 the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics and 6 the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis <EOS>
<SOS> problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports <EOS>
<SOS> therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> based on a broad variety of clinical studies revealing more or less positive results several combinations have been suggested <EOS>
<SOS> the management of <NUM> patients with liver trauma 132 male <NUM> female mean age <NUM> years range 3 88 presenting from january <NUM> to august <NUM> is reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> cases of blunt trauma and <NUM> cases of penetrating injury <EOS>
<SOS> 110 cases were classified as simple injuries grade i or ii and <NUM> cases as complex injuries grade ii to v <EOS>
<SOS> the overall mortality was <NUM> 57 patients <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality for true hepatic injury was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> none of the patients with penetrating injuries died <EOS>
<SOS> mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative complication rate was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma 12 9 and postoperative bleeding 9 6 <EOS>
<SOS> intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents <EOS>
<SOS> in complex injuries hepatotomy direct vessel ligation and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice pachter is procedure <EOS>
<SOS> in non controlled bleeding perihepatic picking is a standard method <EOS>
<SOS> aim the aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge practices and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the berlin dental association using a questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> materials and methods questions focussed on smoking habits knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes <EOS>
<SOS> the questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints <EOS>
<SOS> results of a total of <NUM> questionnaires sent <NUM> were received for evaluation 12 1 <EOS>
<SOS> of respondents 9 5 were regular smokers <EOS>
<SOS> the median number of oral malignancies observed was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate <EOS>
<SOS> a total of 93 1 of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions <EOS>
<SOS> only 35 take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26 6 explain the side effects of tobacco <EOS>
<SOS> some 73 4 believed that the dentist could play a role in anti tobacco counselling <EOS>
<SOS> limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti tobacco counselling <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions this study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti tobacco teaching material <EOS>
<SOS> since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti tobacco counselling adequate programmes in germany should be inititated and followed up <EOS>
<SOS> background last year is pilot study which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with chagas disease showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found <EOS>
<SOS> the posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday <EOS>
<SOS> the authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> in that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint <EOS>
<SOS> finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance tomography mrt has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral mr examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations their pathophysiological background and frequency <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain <EOS>
<SOS> a review of the main differential diagnoses is also given <EOS>
<SOS> the relevance of mr spectroscopy and fetal mri is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors <EOS>
<SOS> one of them is the precise handling of optics <EOS>
<SOS> up to now in our hospital <NUM> laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder stomach large bowel and hernia operations <EOS>
<SOS> the visual field is determined by the surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems <EOS>
<SOS> twenty nine operations were done by one operator as solo surgeries <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> further cases there was one assistant <EOS>
<SOS> a robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater <EOS>
<SOS> urine specimens were collected from <NUM> persons up to <NUM> days after abstaining from cannabis use <EOS>
<SOS> urine samples n 135 were investigated for free and conjugated 9 carboxy 11 nor tetrahydrocannabinol thccooh by lc ms ms and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol thc and 11 hydroxy thc 11 oh thc by gc ms prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis <EOS>
<SOS> concentrations for free and conjugated thccooh were measured with reference to <NUM> mg creatinine dl urine <EOS>
<SOS> cannabis use was classified as light moderate and heavy according to the current literature <EOS>
<SOS> in all groups chosen free and bound thccooh was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day <EOS>
<SOS> urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of thccooh and thccooh glucuronide <EOS>
<SOS> within 4 6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated thccooh in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users <EOS>
<SOS> in frequent users thc glucuronide and 11 oh thc glucuronide could be found up to <NUM> and <NUM> days after abstinence respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in light users neither thc glucuronide nor 11 oh thc glucuronide was detectable <EOS>
<SOS> the determination of conjugated thc and 11 oh thc in addition to free and bound thccooh is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption <EOS>
<SOS> the participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field <EOS>
<SOS> the analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in <NUM> cases during an 11 year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients <EOS>
<SOS> interventions in younger patients most of whom are suffering from psychoses aim at rehabilitation through activity in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders the major concern is to improve posthospital care patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome <EOS>
<SOS> as far as their goals are comparable social workers and doctors agree on their objectives <EOS>
<SOS> social workers usually see their own interventions as successful but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome <EOS>
<SOS> stiff man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff man syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> he has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk starting in the neck <EOS>
<SOS> massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed <EOS>
<SOS> clinical investigation emg cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal thus excluding a stiff man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases <EOS>
<SOS> skin biopsy showed typical changes of buschke is scleredema adultorum a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology <EOS>
<SOS> therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> although rare buschke is scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility <EOS>
<SOS> various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues <EOS>
<SOS> numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections <EOS>
<SOS> valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections <EOS>
<SOS> x ray or ct images allow only a limited three dimensional orientation in presurgical planning <EOS>
<SOS> especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high grade orientation is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> this orientation is improved by a 3d ct controlled manufactured <NUM> model of the pelvis <EOS>

<SOS> using <NUM> different monoclonal antibodies immunohistology was performed on <NUM> follicular adenomas and on <NUM> follicular <NUM> papillary <NUM> medullary and <NUM> anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid <EOS>
<SOS> the panel of antibodies was directed against broad spectrum cytokeratins pan ck antibody lu 5 against basic and acid high molecular weight ck of types <NUM> 1 5 <NUM> and 14 against basic <NUM> and 6 and acid high molecular weight ck 13 and against basic <NUM> and <NUM> 8 and acid low molecular weight ck <NUM> and <NUM> 20 <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan ck ck <NUM> and ck <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> ck <NUM> expression was exclusively shown for <NUM> medullary carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> reactivity for high molecular weight ck could only each time focally be demonstrated for <NUM> papillary and <NUM> follicular carcinomas and for <NUM> anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the ck antibodies applied <EOS>
<SOS> ck <NUM> staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in <NUM> papillary cancers <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with <NUM> follicular carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> these results confirm earlier studies in that ck <NUM> expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad spectrum ck antibodies <EOS>
<SOS> new is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non papillary thyroid tumours regarding ck <NUM> expression <EOS>
<SOS> this result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern <EOS>

<SOS> in addition the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect asd have been developed and tested <EOS>
<SOS> however all systems presently available have some special disadvantages <EOS>
<SOS> the recently introduced amplatzer septal occluder aso though appears promising <EOS>
<SOS> it is a self expanding and self centering double disc made from a nitinol mesh which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength <EOS>
<SOS> both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion <EOS>
<SOS> its diameter may be chosen so that it corresponds to that of the asd <EOS>
<SOS> in the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> they do not stand up to empirical scrutiny <EOS>
<SOS> this applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health <EOS>
<SOS> the monocausal psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model <EOS>
<SOS> in terms of the self object body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function <EOS>
<SOS> the effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> perioperative mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations <EOS>
<SOS> herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease causing microorganisms <EOS>
<SOS> their prevalence can exceed 90 depending on the socioeconomic status of the population <EOS>
<SOS> since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance <EOS>
<SOS> while treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences <EOS>
<SOS> additionally development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we present a case history of a man with a b cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule <EOS>
<SOS> possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability <EOS>
<SOS> despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during whipple is procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general <EOS>
<SOS> the problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein <EOS>
<SOS> often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> patients underwent whipple is procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department <EOS>
<SOS> in eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion <EOS>
<SOS> in all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with ct and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration <EOS>
<SOS> in four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found <EOS>
<SOS> in the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion <EOS>
<SOS> the patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of <NUM> months in contrast to <NUM> months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration <EOS>
<SOS> endovascular intraportal ultrasound ipeus a new diagnostic procedure can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement <EOS>
<SOS> although the ipeus is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity <EOS>
<SOS> our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by ipeus patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection <EOS>
<SOS> progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies <EOS>
<SOS> this does also apply for stroke treatment new pathophysiological knowledge positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at stroke units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency <EOS>
<SOS> timing is of utmost importance <EOS>
<SOS> time based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment process is divided into three phases alarming pre hospital and in hospital phase <EOS>
<SOS> the effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables personnel technical equipment course of the disease etc <EOS>
<SOS> knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses which allows an aimed improvement e g <EOS>
<SOS> public education training of paramedics and medical personnel <EOS>
<SOS> modern communication systems allow new information transfer which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients <EOS>
<SOS> prosthetic valve endocarditis pve is a severe complication after heart valve replacement <EOS>
<SOS> incidence ranges in literature between 0 1 and 2 3 mean 0 4 per patient year pty <EOS>
<SOS> pve is classified as early or late occurence within or after <NUM> days following heart valve replacement <EOS>
<SOS> in this review we present the clinical outcome of pve as well as the most common diagnostic criteria duke criteria the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria <EOS>
<SOS> the spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards <EOS>
<SOS> recently intra atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> low energy intra atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f ex <EOS>
<SOS> after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> intra atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far <EOS>
<SOS> especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy <EOS>
<SOS> modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the aim is three dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation <EOS>
<SOS> hereby the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined <EOS>
<SOS> precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite <EOS>
<SOS> the immobilization method has an accuracy of less than <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> this method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of <NUM> was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> this indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method <EOS>
<SOS> the integration of functional image information such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas will be evaluated in the future <EOS>
<SOS> olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome ips <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of ips clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed <EOS>
<SOS> this may be due to the lack of an easy to use <NUM> inexpensive standardized and reliable test <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we administered the newly developed sniffing sticks test to a group of <NUM> nondemented ips patients and compared the results with <NUM> healthy controls matched for age gender and smoking habits <EOS>
<SOS> in all three subtests including odor identification odor detection threshold and odor discrimination the control group scored significantly better than the ips group yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90 each <EOS>
<SOS> our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in ips can be found at early stages of the disease appear bilaterally and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ips <EOS>
<SOS> purpose the goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional mri to establish computer based preoperative therapy planning for tumors instancing cervical carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> drug induced toxic epidermal necrolysis ten is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology <EOS>
<SOS> toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years <EOS>
<SOS> results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age <EOS>
<SOS> in order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure <EOS>
<SOS> in dermis and epidermis there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of cd8 positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction <EOS>
<SOS> an increased staining of lesional epidermis with tnf as previously noted by other autors should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of the clinical results the pathogenetic considerations and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in problematic cases however optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases external frontal sinus surgery is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation <EOS>
<SOS> its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases one with a küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail <EOS>
<SOS> this event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex <EOS>
<SOS> both the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail realize certain therapeutic concepts <EOS>
<SOS> their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful <EOS>
<SOS> primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases <EOS>
<SOS> secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of hcg and afp in csf <EOS>
<SOS> adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of hcg in csf <EOS>
<SOS> six years before a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> this demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline sized brain tumors by evaluation of hcg and afp in csf and serum <EOS>
<SOS> today different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> however the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial <EOS>
<SOS> recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting cns germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high dose polychemotherapy surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area <EOS>
<SOS> hcg and afp may serve as useful markers to enable follow up of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> in order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the orthopedic university clinic of heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients <EOS>
<SOS> according to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database <EOS>
<SOS> these data were controlled complemented and classified by members of the quality menagement group <EOS>
<SOS> this guideline consists of five parts catalogue of diagnoses general and special definitions classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity <EOS>
<SOS> the internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications <EOS>
<SOS> finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the web is rising quickly <EOS>
<SOS> even the best search engines can only collect links to a fraction of all existing web pages <EOS>
<SOS> in addition many of these indexed documents have been changed or deleted <EOS>
<SOS> the vast majority of information on the web is not searchable with conventional methods <EOS>
<SOS> new search strategies technologies and standards are combined in intelligent search agents isa and robots which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach <EOS>
<SOS> with the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging mri contrast enhanced computed tomography ct and transesophageal echocardiography tee diagnostic options in the evaluation of marfan patients have been improved profoundly <EOS>
<SOS> the most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts and molecular analysis at the cdna dna level of the fibrillin 1 gene <EOS>
<SOS> new diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of marfan syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence gravidity as well as in the pre and postoperative patient <EOS>
<SOS> primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias dysostoses and dysplasias <EOS>
<SOS> hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal <EOS>
<SOS> generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy <NUM> and ullrich turner syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences <EOS>
<SOS> dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue <EOS>
<SOS> some of them e g achondroplasia jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components <EOS>
<SOS> examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias <EOS>
<SOS> finally disorders such as pycnodysostosis result from defects of chondro osseous homeostasis <EOS>
<SOS> the study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development <EOS>
<SOS> human parvovirus b19 causes erythema infectiosum fifth disease and aplastic crisis <EOS>
<SOS> in pregnancy b19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis <EOS>
<SOS> b19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis <EOS>
<SOS> in immunocompromised patients b19 may persist causing chronic infection <EOS>
<SOS> several methods for detecting b19 virus or specific antibodies are now available <EOS>
<SOS> b19 infection does not usually require therapy <EOS>
<SOS> efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic b19 infection has been demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> in absence of significant symptoms and signs the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism pe remains difficult <EOS>
<SOS> sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests chest x ray and ecg on their own is low <EOS>
<SOS> echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload <EOS>
<SOS> venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected pe but normal results do not rule out pe <EOS>
<SOS> helical ct with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli <EOS>
<SOS> however if the ct findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment several diagnostic techniques and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases <EOS>
<SOS> heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics <EOS>
<SOS> thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients <EOS>
<SOS> in short term dose regimes the thrombolytic agents urokinase streptokinase and rt pa seem to be equally efficient <EOS>
<SOS> so far however no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism <EOS>
<SOS> background data on mesopic vision after lasik are not available to date <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after lasik <EOS>
<SOS> renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios potter is sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure <EOS>
<SOS> it is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner <EOS>
<SOS> definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> two additional cases of affected sibs in a family with parental consanguinity are reported <EOS>
<SOS> lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule <EOS>
<SOS> further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> articular cartilage has only a small capacity for regneration <EOS>
<SOS> this makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints <EOS>
<SOS> this operation is still in widespread use today <EOS>
<SOS> pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro cartilaginous repair <EOS>
<SOS> the newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient serverity of symptoms activity level and functional demands on the joint site and stage of the lesion <EOS>
<SOS> the drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans <EOS>
<SOS> recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology ameliorations in clinical trial design and mri developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis ms <EOS>
<SOS> however in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments a number of therapeutical failures exist as well despite impressive data from animal models convincing concepts and promising phase i ii studies some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects <EOS>
<SOS> this article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons <EOS>
<SOS> tumor necrosis factor tnf antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies lenercept infliximab are discussed in detail <EOS>
<SOS> these results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of ms lesions and the value of mri in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to a description of the immunobiological background studies on the immunosuppressive agents linomide deoxyspergualin sulfasalazine and cladribine trials for the cytokines interleukin 10 and tgf 2 the studies on remyelination by intravenous immunoglobulins ivig oral tolerance and extracorporeal photopheresis are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> isolated pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinomas rcc are extremely rare <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> cases of clinically diagnosed renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature and <NUM> of the patients including ours underwent a definitive surgical resection <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease free interval <EOS>
<SOS> when it does occur simultaneously or metachronously aggressive surgical resection when possible seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion <EOS>
<SOS> surgical resection can provide long term survival in selected cases <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 69 year old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy <NUM> years after radical nephrectomy for a rcc <EOS>
<SOS> the patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right sided colon cancer <EOS>
<SOS> thus the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially <EOS>
<SOS> both tumors were radically resected and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous rcc <EOS>
<SOS> in the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to rcc <EOS>
<SOS> it illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> the need for prolonged follow up of patients is emphasized <EOS>
<SOS> the few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from rcc are reviewed after the presentation of this case <EOS>
<SOS> delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder <EOS>
<SOS> the perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context <EOS>
<SOS> the realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion <EOS>
<SOS> the failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement <EOS>
<SOS> based on a case study considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification <EOS>
<SOS> high dose chemotherapy hdct is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist as the indication has to be carefully established <EOS>
<SOS> exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions <EOS>
<SOS> prior to hdct haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional dose chemotherapy plus g or gm csf stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> hdct consists of a combination of carboplatin etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide <EOS>
<SOS> after hdct haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential <EOS>
<SOS> it is therefore recommended that hdct only be administered at specialized centres <EOS>
<SOS> pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of <NUM> and <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> it usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease <EOS>
<SOS> several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described <EOS>
<SOS> extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly <EOS>
<SOS> malignant pyoderma the variant described in our case report is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist <EOS>
<SOS> histopathologic findings however always include vasculitis either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis 7 granulomatous 1 or lymphocytic vasculitis 2 <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 36 year old male patient who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch <EOS>
<SOS> the aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit <EOS>
<SOS> an association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum <EOS>
<SOS> we could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine <EOS>
<SOS> background and purpose to test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts <EOS>
<SOS> defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit <EOS>
<SOS> for the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency <EOS>
<SOS> the main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures <EOS>
<SOS> with a transpedicular screw ringband system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished <EOS>
<SOS> after rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure <EOS>
<SOS> ct or mri guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit <EOS>
<SOS> analysing <NUM> cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed in <NUM> patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r tpa <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained <EOS>
<SOS> a stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep seated lesions was performed in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was <NUM> in our series in accordance to other authors <EOS>
<SOS> the stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> the stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk <EOS>
<SOS> the aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r tpa or urokinase <EOS>
<SOS> with stereotactic guidance small deep seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed <EOS>
<SOS> radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages t1 t2 <EOS>
<SOS> in locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> recent developments in linear accellerator technique the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time <EOS>
<SOS> these improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone <EOS>
<SOS> in special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> future developments i e intensity modulated radiotherapy imrt combined thermo radiotherapy proton or neutrontherapy may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> the significance of cutaneous b cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years <EOS>
<SOS> cutaneous b cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology immunophenotype and in prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas marginal zone b cell lymphomas and diffuse large b cell lymphomas <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of primary cutaneous b cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> whereas in b cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> it is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph node based counterparts <EOS>
<SOS> in the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous b cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous b cell lymphomas is discussed according to the who classification sheme <EOS>
<SOS> the phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non competitive n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor antagonist with the thalamo neocortical projection system as the primary site of action <EOS>
<SOS> racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers s ketamine and r ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since <NUM> it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism cmro2 and increases cerebral blood flow cbf and intracranial pressure icp <EOS>
<SOS> however recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and s ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury <EOS>
<SOS> this experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in ca influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to nmda and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine 2 0 mg kg increases cbf in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator n2o <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine 100 mg kg i p <EOS>
<SOS> this suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics <EOS>
<SOS> cerebrovascular co2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance <EOS>
<SOS> there are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase cbf <EOS>
<SOS> it induces dose dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects <EOS>
<SOS> this produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular co2 reactivity <EOS>
<SOS> racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic extrapyramidal auditory and sensory motor systems <EOS>
<SOS> this regional neuroexcitation with increased cmro2 produces increases in cbf that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines <EOS>
<SOS> however increases in cbf with racemic ketamine 1 mg kg may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in cmro2 <EOS>
<SOS> this effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of ca channels <EOS>
<SOS> the effects of racemic ketamine on cbf autoregulation have not been investigated systematically <EOS>
<SOS> however studies in rats have shown that cbf autoregulation was maintained with low and high dose s ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and icp <EOS>
<SOS> studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine <MOB> mg kg produces increases in paco2 and icp <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled paco2 showed no changes in icp following racemic ketamine infusion <EOS>
<SOS> this implies that increases in icp are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume <EOS>
<SOS> however mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control icp following racemic ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine 2 mg kg increases cerebral blood volume and icp even in the presence of normoventilation a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam <EOS>
<SOS> studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine 2 0 mg kg reduces cbf in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or n2o <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine 2 3 mg kg <EOS>
<SOS> this observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics <EOS>
<SOS> dengue fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease <EOS>
<SOS> it is endemic mainly in south east asia and afrika <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical manifestation is divided into different stages <EOS>
<SOS> ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported <EOS>
<SOS> sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye <EOS>
<SOS> multiple factors may cause tear film instability <EOS>
<SOS> measuring the break up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability <EOS>
<SOS> we designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break up phenomena <EOS>

<SOS> background an abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia <EOS>
<SOS> our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in <NUM> consecutive patients with microvascular angina only moderately elevated ldl cholesterol levels 168 <NUM> mg dl and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal n 9 or slightly abnormal n 9 coronary arteriograms minimal disease with luminal irregularities and or diameter reduction 30 before and after 6 month lipid lowering therapy simvastatin <EOS>
<SOS> methods regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation 0 56 mg kg using dynamic positron emission tomography pet and n 13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3 compartment kinetic model <EOS>
<SOS> baseline data mean sd <NUM> males <NUM> females mean age <NUM> <NUM> years basal coronary flow <NUM> <NUM> ml minx100 g after lipid intervention <NUM> <NUM> ml minx100 g n s <EOS>

<SOS> concomitantly a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions an improvement of the non invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after <NUM> months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> consequently aggressive cholesterol lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting at least in part functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression <EOS>

<SOS> eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2 6 diaminopyridine patch test positive this healed upon cessation of exposure <EOS>
<SOS> ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis <EOS>
<SOS> under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work it healed nearly completly <EOS>
<SOS> four months after returning to work the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before <EOS>
<SOS> the asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work <EOS>
<SOS> his condition continued to fluctuate when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves <EOS>
<SOS> eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> patch testing revealed delayed type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine tested in concentrations of 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 <EOS>
<SOS> equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative <EOS>
<SOS> the patch test reactions were pustular while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction <EOS>
<SOS> bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next <NUM> hours which progressed to fever and generalized erythema hematogenous contact dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> after removing exposure to 2 6 diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex patch test positive <EOS>
<SOS> however skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative <EOS>
<SOS> hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions <EOS>
<SOS> to our knowledge contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported <EOS>
<SOS> it is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction <EOS>
<SOS> pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin cobalt and nickel induced asthma <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin <EOS>
<SOS> one month later the right achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain <EOS>
<SOS> mri revealed degenerative changes of the left achilles tendon on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of <NUM> cm between both ends of the tendon <EOS>
<SOS> the tendon was reconstructed surgically <EOS>
<SOS> the histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> this finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies <EOS>
<SOS> after antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors <EOS>
<SOS> several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation <EOS>
<SOS> functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the dna <EOS>
<SOS> as our understanding of the nature function and interaction of these genes evolves new opportunities for early diagnosis classification prevention and treatment of malignant tumors will arise <EOS>
<SOS> the present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes erbb ras myc raf fos jun bcl mdm 2 myb kit csf1r met and tumor suppressor genes p 53 rb mts involved in lung cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned <EOS>
<SOS> hyperbaric oxygen hbo therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100 of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure <EOS>
<SOS> it is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities <EOS>
<SOS> for the clinical use of hbo therapy according to international recommendations there are several commonly accepted indications in which hbo either is the only causative life saving kind of treatment or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy <EOS>
<SOS> among potential adverse effects barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned <EOS>
<SOS> clinical use of hbo therefore requires special knowledge of its effects risks and adverse effects a clear and distinct indication and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist <EOS>
<SOS> although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures we assessed <NUM> consecutive ankle fractures immediately before orif <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> male and <NUM> female patients with an average age of <NUM> years <MOB> years <EOS>
<SOS> there were more cartilage lesions found than expected and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type c fractures than in type b fractures <EOS>
<SOS> in both fracture types an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in addition more ligament injuries were found than expected especially in the b 1 and b 2 fractures <EOS>
<SOS> successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in <NUM> cases internal fixation 9 loose body removal 7 ligament reposition 5 cartilage smoothening 4 and cartilage fracture repair <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in one case a periostal flap could not be reduced and in another case the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable <EOS>
<SOS> in summary arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures <EOS>
<SOS> as long term results are not yet available it remains however unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following orif <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> of these percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication <EOS>
<SOS> objective transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index basfi and dougados functional index d fi <EOS>
<SOS> methods the instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency cronbach is coefficient alpha test retest reliability intraclass correlation coefficient icc construct validity testing for association with schober is test finger floor distance occiput wall distance frequency and duration of awakenings at night and a visual analog scale pain and responsiveness standardized response mean srm <EOS>
<SOS> results the study sample consisted of <NUM> patients of a randomized controlled clinical trial receiving either diclofenac or placebo <EOS>
<SOS> visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments <EOS>
<SOS> both questionnaires had a high internal consistency cronbach alpha <NUM> basfi <NUM> d fi and a high test retest reliability icc <NUM> basfi <NUM> d fi <EOS>
<SOS> the limited responsiveness to diclofenac treatment srm <NUM> basfi <NUM> <NUM> d fi may be related to the selected study sample <EOS>
<SOS> the basfi was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> d fi was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance occiput wall distance and duration of awakenings at night <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion the transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid reliable and internally consistent <EOS>
<SOS> because of psychometric advantages the basfi may be preferred in clinical trial settings <EOS>
<SOS> the role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain <EOS>
<SOS> interpretation of the few prospective studies rtog 75 06 and 77 06 is hampered by severe flaws in the study design <EOS>
<SOS> extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted <EOS>
<SOS> data on longterm side effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques <EOS>
<SOS> according to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone <EOS>
<SOS> in summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> in reconstruction of cartilage defects autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method <EOS>
<SOS> although a clinical application has not been reported until now tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms <EOS>
<SOS> among other methods for in vivo tissue protection the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences <EOS>
<SOS> human septal cartilage was encapsulated group 1 with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice <EOS>
<SOS> cartilage implants without encapsulation group 2 were used as control <EOS>
<SOS> scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1 4 8 <NUM> and <NUM> weeks after implantation <EOS>
<SOS> group <NUM> showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast group <NUM> presented correlating to the time of implanta tion increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation representing an increased activity of resorption <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences <EOS>
<SOS> for the plastic reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable <EOS>
<SOS> subjective time experience and objective time estimation were examined in <NUM> endogenous <NUM> neurotic depressives and <NUM> healthy volunteers <EOS>
<SOS> subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls <EOS>
<SOS> objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives <EOS>
<SOS> the perception of extended time normalized during treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the depressives time perception differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and to a lesser degree with retardation <EOS>
<SOS> the findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives <EOS>
<SOS> amelioration of experienced time extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of lewinsohn <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated whether the free to total prostate specific antigen psa ratio f psa t psa ratio i e percentage of free psa represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate cap <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective analysis the persentage of free psa was determined in the sera of <NUM> patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia bph and <NUM> patients with clinically localized cap <EOS>
<SOS> patients with urolithiasis n 33 served as a control group <EOS>
<SOS> serum levels of free psa and total psa were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay <EOS>
<SOS> patients with cap demonstrated a lower percentage of free psa median 8 7 than patients with bph median 20 0 p 0 001 and those with urolithiasis median 18 8 p 0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> determination of the percentage of free psa enhances the differentiation between bph and cap and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated psa <EOS>
<SOS> confirmation of our preliminary results is required <EOS>
<SOS> psychological problems in children and parents related to children is atopic eczema ae may impede the success of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we studied the question if behavior based parental education in groups dpe or standardized video education vpe could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers <EOS>
<SOS> sevoflurane degrades in co2 absorbents to produce compound a which may have <NUM> hepatotoxic potential in humans <EOS>
<SOS> several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential <EOS>
<SOS> three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3 concentration for <NUM> h duration at approximately <NUM> l min flow rate <EOS>
<SOS> the initial investigation found high excretion of protein glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane <EOS>
<SOS> subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers <EOS>
<SOS> one additional investigation in volunteers studied 3 sevoflurane anesthesia for <NUM> h duration using a low flow 1 l min technique <EOS>
<SOS> no significant excretion of protein glucose or renal enzymes was observed <EOS>
<SOS> application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration <EOS>
<SOS> although some controversy remains these data combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients suggest that renal function following modest duration low flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> background the microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery <EOS>
<SOS> streptococci and escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast fed newborns <EOS>
<SOS> they provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen <EOS>
<SOS> a mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant <EOS>
<SOS> bifidobacteria bacteroides enterobacteriaceae streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora <EOS>
<SOS> this represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults <EOS>
<SOS> the bifidogenic effect of mothers milk is based on the active substances it contains which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora <EOS>
<SOS> bifidus enhancing factors in breast feeding are lactose oligosaccharides glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother <EOS>
<SOS> factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies lactoferrin lysozyme fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers milk <EOS>
<SOS> a bifidus inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth canal infections which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births <EOS>
<SOS> an increasing number of surgical deliveries the separation of the newborn infant from its mother and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life threatening nosocomial infections <EOS>
<SOS> counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and december 1987 metatarsal head resections were performed on <NUM> patients comprising a total of <NUM> feet using the hueter mayo and hoffmann procedure <EOS>
<SOS> seventy two patients comprising a total of <NUM> feet were available for post operative review after an average of <NUM> years from the date of the original operations <EOS>
<SOS> the information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient is file <EOS>
<SOS> in addition every available pre and post operative x ray taken from <NUM> to <NUM> was analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> thus with an average follow up period of <NUM> years the changes found in the pre and post operative x rays from a total of <NUM> feet could be compared <EOS>
<SOS> before the operations nearly 100 of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation causing approximately 70 of all patients to have great difficulties in walking <EOS>
<SOS> after the operations however 90 2 of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> in fact 87 5 of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances <EOS>
<SOS> as the main criteria in determining the success of an operation namely the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility were achieved in 87 5 of the patients we consider the metatarsal head resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis <EOS>
<SOS> bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons <EOS>
<SOS> bone morphogenetic proteins bmps as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> within this study we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation and differentiation rate of osteoblast like cells <EOS>
<SOS> for that purpose human osteoblast like cells hpoc were incubated in the presence of either recombinant bmp 4 of the genome of xenopus laevis rxbmp 4 recombinant human bmp <NUM> rhbmp 2 transforming growth factor ß tgf ß or basic fibroblast growth factor rh bfgf in two different concentrations each 10 ng ml and <NUM> ng ml <EOS>
<SOS> cell proliferation was measured within a mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromid assay the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase <EOS>
<SOS> rx bmp 4 induced a differentiation of hpoc to almost the same extent as rhbmp 2 whereas the addition of rh bfgf applied at the same concentration failed to have any influence on cell differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> however rh bfgf provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated hpoc while rhbmp 2 and rxbmp 4 showed no effect on proliferation <EOS>
<SOS> tgf ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly <EOS>
<SOS> the equipotent effect of recombinant human bmp 2 and recombinant bmp 4 obtained from xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for bmp <NUM> as well as bmp 4 or that both bmp is link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity <EOS>
<SOS> sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region <EOS>
<SOS> the ent surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick non invasive and last but not least less expensive method <EOS>
<SOS> due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications <EOS>
<SOS> after inauguration of color doppler sonography non invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible <EOS>
<SOS> this issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss vertigo and tinnitus <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the extent of perfusion of space occupying lesions can be easily examined and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient <EOS>
<SOS> especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion <EOS>
<SOS> in several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices <EOS>
<SOS> however other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps therefore final judgment does not seem to be possible yet <EOS>
<SOS> use of echo contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color doppler imaging <EOS>
<SOS> painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat <EOS>
<SOS> the nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder adhesive capsulitis focal algodystrophy stiff shoulder contracted shoulder and others <EOS>
<SOS> apart from its idiopathic form the disease can be initiated by trauma infection tumour radiation systemic and local metabolic disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> pathoanatomically the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening scarring and retraction of the joint capsule <EOS>
<SOS> the inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma rcc is not treated is unfavorable with a reported 5 year survival of 0 18 <EOS>
<SOS> before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival giving a 5 year survival of 7 69 <EOS>
<SOS> retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> some patients will benefit from resection of metastases but most patients with metastatic rcc are not candidates for such aggressive surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the use of interleukin 2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions <EOS>
<SOS> without randomized trials it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long lasting remissions in selected patients <EOS>
<SOS> many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit to risk ratio of immunotherapy but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic rcc <EOS>
<SOS> after loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired <EOS>
<SOS> fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function <EOS>
<SOS> the use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier <EOS>
<SOS> shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active <EOS>
<SOS> but fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the unreamed femoral nail ufn system with its numerous proximal interlocking options allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns <EOS>
<SOS> sixty six fractures <NUM> cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures <NUM> limb shortenings and <NUM> lengthening monorail technique and <NUM> cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the ufn from july <NUM> to december <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the fractures were analysed according to the ao classification <EOS>
<SOS> we found <NUM> polytrauma patients with an mean iss of <NUM> and a mean pts of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> most of the multiply injured patients n 26 were stabilised with the ufn primarily <EOS>
<SOS> follow up of <NUM> patients ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> months postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> according to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in <NUM> of cases good in <NUM> poor in <NUM> and bad in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> average fracture healing time was about <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the atlas account for 1 2 of all vertebral fractures <EOS>
<SOS> we divide atlas fractures into <NUM> groups isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas isolated fractures of the posterior arch combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch so called jefferson fractures isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process <EOS>
<SOS> isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament <EOS>
<SOS> stable jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto axial or occipito axial stabilization and fusion <EOS>
<SOS> the authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation c1 c2 according to magerl <EOS>
<SOS> this has the advantage of saving the atlanto occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or minerva cast superfluous <EOS>
<SOS> in late instabilities c1 2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment an occipito cervical fusion is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may if the lateral mass is totally destroyed be a reason for an occipito cervical fusion <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery <EOS>
<SOS> no treatment is necessary for the fracture itself <EOS>
<SOS> reported is the case of a 36 year old man with neurofibromatosis type <NUM> with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery <EOS>
<SOS> histologically and immunohistochemically no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected <EOS>
<SOS> considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 2 year old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood cbdc <EOS>
<SOS> concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by salmonella enteritidis the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face <EOS>
<SOS> following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p o <EOS>
<SOS> she developed typical symptoms of cbdc i e <EOS>
<SOS> tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face <EOS>
<SOS> direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear iga deposition along the basement membrane zone confirming the diagnosis of cbdc <EOS>
<SOS> these lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p o <EOS>
<SOS> this case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood <EOS>
<SOS> systemic administration of strontium 89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases <EOS>
<SOS> recently rhenium 186 hedp was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages shorter physical half life scintigraphic imaging dose distribution <EOS>
<SOS> the myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often <EOS>
<SOS> our study comprises <NUM> treatments with rhenium 186 hedp in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1 4 to 2 fold standard dose <EOS>
<SOS> the response rate estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility was <NUM> with no major myelosuppressive effects <EOS>
<SOS> the mean duration of pain relief was 4 6 weeks <EOS>
<SOS> all four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment <EOS>
<SOS> radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium 186 hedp appears to be an effective and even at higher doses safe procedure <EOS>
<SOS> cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus sle <EOS>
<SOS> it is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis <EOS>
<SOS> within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe sle due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application <EOS>
<SOS> studies on the slightly more cost effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published however there are no data on long term results yet <EOS>
<SOS> here we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in sle <EOS>
<SOS> because of the possible side effects especially the high risk of malignancies which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously <EOS>
<SOS> cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience <EOS>
<SOS> the optimal time to perform acute acl reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> most authors prefer delayed surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the definition of the term acute varies between <NUM> hours and <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the limit was set at <NUM> hours <EOS>
<SOS> acute acl reconstruction was performed in <NUM> patients and delayed surgery in <NUM> after they had regained full rom <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44 lower in this population <EOS>
<SOS> when the indication is clear we think that acute acl reconstruction may be performed within <NUM> hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis <EOS>
<SOS> nowadays this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons <EOS>
<SOS> after some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent centered programs <EOS>
<SOS> positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development parental sensitivity and the home environment <EOS>
<SOS> only parent centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent infant interaction <EOS>
<SOS> it is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term <EOS>
<SOS> further programs should focus on parent and parent infant centered interventions <EOS>
<SOS> methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent centered interventions are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described <EOS>
<SOS> mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand <EOS>
<SOS> a forearm orthesis with a simply rom joint without reboundmechanism was used <EOS>
<SOS> possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated <EOS>
<SOS> matrix metalloproteinases mmp and their tissue inhibitors timp are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> in the study presented matrix metalloproteinase <NUM> mmp1 and <NUM> mmp3 the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase <NUM> timp1 and the complex mmp1 timp1 were measured by elisa tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma <EOS>
<SOS> these components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients pca with metastases n 18 t2 3 <NUM> pn1 2m1 prostate cancer patients without metastases n 29 t2 <NUM> pn0m0 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia bph n 29 and in healthy men n 35 <EOS>
<SOS> mean values of mmp1 and of the complex mmp1 timp1 were not different among the four groups <EOS>
<SOS> the mean values of mmp3 and especially timp1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls bph patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases <EOS>
<SOS> ten of these <NUM> patients had timp1 levels higher than the upper reference limit <EOS>
<SOS> timp1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade <EOS>
<SOS> these results indicate that timp1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients <EOS>
<SOS> the interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach <EOS>
<SOS> as in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device asdos is affected by late complications particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations <EOS>
<SOS> the demonstration of <NUM> case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an asdos device <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation <EOS>
<SOS> for early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after asdos implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential <EOS>
<SOS> every asdos patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography <EOS>
<SOS> the emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances <EOS>
<SOS> this study evaluated the long term outcome of patients with out of hospital cardiac arrests in a country area <EOS>
<SOS> the economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant <EOS>
<SOS> approximately <NUM> to 2 of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> a great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long term complications and productivity losses <EOS>
<SOS> in order to manage these costs providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions <EOS>
<SOS> teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics <EOS>
<SOS> due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future <EOS>
<SOS> rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation based upon an isdn network in the beginning later on by the use of a national health network <EOS>
<SOS> the medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery <EOS>

<SOS> half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person a total of <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> symptoms findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca <EOS>
<SOS> 50 of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half <EOS>
<SOS> it is noteworthy that the physician is point of view was influenced by personal accident experience accident as a car passenger 54 of the <NUM> physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35 of <NUM> physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22 of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62 of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement <EOS>

<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging mri is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a new mri technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography <EOS>
<SOS> this technique is based on three dimensional t1 and t2 weighted sequences <EOS>
<SOS> the familiar panoramic view in mri provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier <EOS>
<SOS> however the acquisition time is long 6 12 min per sequence with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the final workup is also time consuming <EOS>
<SOS> these restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software <EOS>

<SOS> diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients movements during gait considerably <EOS>
<SOS> because of biomechanical overload articular structures tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography sonography us or magnetic resonance imaging mri <EOS>
<SOS> findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis <EOS>
<SOS> despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings high variability of x ray signs may occur <EOS>
<SOS> plain film radiograms and high resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot <EOS>
<SOS> mri supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases <EOS>
<SOS> the principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment <EOS>

<SOS> the aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors <EOS>
<SOS> basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf was incorporated into dl polylactic acid pla pellets under hyperbaric co2 pressure in two different ways <EOS>
<SOS> 1 lyophilized bfgf was crushed and mixed with pla granules filled into cylindric moulds of <NUM> x <NUM> mm and submitted to hyperbaric co2 pressure <EOS>
<SOS> 2 lyophilized bfgf was reconstituted in phosphate buffer mixed with pla granules and relyophilized <EOS>
<SOS> in vitro assessment of bfgf release from the pla implants by immunoassay showed that loading of pla with crushed lyophilized bfgf resulted in a rapid and high release while loading by solubilized bfgf and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor <EOS>
<SOS> intestinal neuronal dysplasia ind was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease <EOS>
<SOS> the investigation was performed with <NUM> adults with ind compared with <NUM> healthy control probands <EOS>

<SOS> management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial <EOS>
<SOS> local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions <EOS>
<SOS> the vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction vpler may be a more successful approach to such lesions <EOS>
<SOS> the charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between <NUM> and <NUM> at the authors institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with vpler as described by sedlacek in 1965 kambic in <NUM> and tucker in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery surgical technique perioperative complications oncological outcomes and functional results <EOS>
<SOS> twelve patients were identified that had been treated with vpler <EOS>
<SOS> indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure t2 n0 2 m0 two with local recurrences following radiotherapy and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy <EOS>
<SOS> there were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day <EOS>
<SOS> all had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing a mean of <NUM> days after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> phonatory results were usually poor <EOS>
<SOS> two local recurrences occurred during the follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> however both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease <EOS>
<SOS> all other patients are alive and well <EOS>
<SOS> our findings show that vpler is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy <EOS>
<SOS> this study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery <EOS>
<SOS> no major complications occurred in our study <EOS>
<SOS> traditionally intra vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia fmd of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography <EOS>
<SOS> we are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery fmd in one case each <EOS>
<SOS> we present a patient in whom color coded duplex sonography revealed a web like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal fmd <EOS>
<SOS> the relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> data analysis was based on two assumptions 1 presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery and therefore depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure <EOS>
<SOS> 2 postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery and therefore depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure <EOS>
<SOS> the sample was made up of <NUM> patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and <NUM> patients with lumbar spondylodesis <EOS>
<SOS> treatment outcome was evaluated <NUM> months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and <NUM> months after surgery in the spondylodesis group <EOS>
<SOS> depression was assessed with the beck depression inventory bdi <EOS>
<SOS> measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result functional impairment return to work subjective estimations of the patient and pain intensity <EOS>
<SOS> presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients <EOS>
<SOS> in spondylodesis patients however there was a significant negative correlation with the patients subjective outcome ratings <EOS>
<SOS> postsurgical depression scores on the other hand were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups <EOS>
<SOS> patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores <EOS>
<SOS> our findings favour assumption <NUM> over assumption <EOS>
<SOS> in the light of our findings depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non beneficial outcome of surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> using electron beam computed tomography ebct with short exposure times of <NUM> or <NUM> ms and the capability of acquiring up to <NUM> x <NUM> images s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart <EOS>
<SOS> various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of ebct to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes ml myocardial mass g wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle mm s myocardial perfusion ml 100 g min and the extent of coronary calcification calcium score and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4 6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> the knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions <EOS>
<SOS> further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants especially myocardial perfusion using this advanced ct technology <EOS>
<SOS> fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence <EOS>
<SOS> the majority occur in sport and play activities e g a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike or from popular sports items such as skateboards or in line skates <EOS>
<SOS> the injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus proximal radius and ulna or combinations of both <EOS>
<SOS> in addition extra and intraarticular fracture types are defined with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions <EOS>
<SOS> dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture <EOS>
<SOS> supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions <EOS>
<SOS> in the forearm radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical monteggia injuries have a special status <EOS>
<SOS> the complex joint construction and the age dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult <EOS>
<SOS> the trauma history and an exact clinical examination help to verify the injury as do comparative x ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary but not routinely <EOS>
<SOS> unlike other anatomical areas most elbow injuries even in the growing skeleton are treated operatively <EOS>
<SOS> hereby the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants <EOS>
<SOS> additional immobilization in a cast for <NUM> <NUM> weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit in contrast to adults <EOS>
<SOS> the implants should be removed as early as possible <EOS>
<SOS> despite all therapeutic efforts a significant number of late sequelae such as malunions and functional impairment can be seen <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of long term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability <EOS>
<SOS> corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed <EOS>
<SOS> our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long term follow up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children <EOS>
<SOS> errors in diagnosis and therapy as well as possible complications are pointed out <EOS>
<SOS> 2 adrenergic agonists mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity <EOS>
<SOS> there is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine <EOS>
<SOS> clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic neuralgic and deafferentiating pain <EOS>
<SOS> based on a meta analysis of the studies published in the years <MOB> the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states <EOS>
<SOS> out of <NUM> screened published studies only <NUM> fulfilled the selection criteria <EOS>
<SOS> besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment four placebo controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms painful diabetic neuropathy postherpetic neuralgia hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain <EOS>
<SOS> although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight <EOS>
<SOS> long term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical transdermal application of clonidine <EOS>
<SOS> based on this evaluation a grade c recommendation is derived which relates to responders <EOS>
<SOS> successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in chronic pain treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value <EOS>
<SOS> study objective to investigate whether automatic tube compensation atc or conventional pressure support ps is suit able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern <EOS>
<SOS> dna based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa rdeb <EOS>
<SOS> dna from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring dna from parental leukocytes and dna from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct pcr amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type vii collagen gene the canditate gene in rdeb <EOS>
<SOS> one flanking marker d3s2 mspi as well as two intragenic polymorphisms c7 mspi c7 eco0109i in exons <NUM> and <NUM> were informative in this family <EOS>
<SOS> thus based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in rdeb a phenotypically healthy child was predicted <EOS>
<SOS> this prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant <EOS>
<SOS> the study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by pcr based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe rdeb <EOS>
<SOS> endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties <EOS>
<SOS> it has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term <EOS>
<SOS> however in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> the synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts <EOS>
<SOS> this review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of fast mr sequences and rapid i v injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> mr perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to test whether mr perfusion imaging with a clinical mr scanner using a standard 2d flash sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors <EOS>
<SOS> brain infarctions lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls <EOS>
<SOS> however our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow <EOS>
<SOS> lumbar microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach <EOS>
<SOS> the microscope is the best surgical aid <EOS>
<SOS> alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp <EOS>
<SOS> a specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy the wrong level can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning <EOS>
<SOS> other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view <EOS>
<SOS> the most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation major vessel or visceral injury can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> to march <NUM> three hospitals in the city of magdeburg treated a total of <NUM> subcutaneous achilles tendon ruptures operatively <EOS>
<SOS> we created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used <EOS>
<SOS> important aspects of the follow up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a kin trex dynamic measuring device and the clinical check up in comparison with the histological results and the patients history <EOS>
<SOS> degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38 8 of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> the average score of all op methods applied was <NUM> of possible <NUM> points <EOS>
<SOS> the adaptation suture 781 points silfverskiold is technique 772 points and the fibrin adhesive technique 754 points showed approximately the same results <EOS>
<SOS> the theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong <EOS>
<SOS> isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load <EOS>
<SOS> to determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain we investigated <NUM> patients before during and after general anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> we examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated <EOS>
<SOS> for complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used <EOS>
<SOS> somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side inclination and retroflexion in segment o c1 <EOS>
<SOS> both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations 89 1 similar restraints of joint motions <EOS>
<SOS> to 10 9 were found that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission <EOS>
<SOS> different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results <EOS>
<SOS> we assume that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> this disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently we discuss to replace the term somatic dysfunction through segmental dysfunction and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra abdominal operations <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative delay of bowel movement however is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used <EOS>
<SOS> in order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic induced postoperative delay of bowel movement two types of intravenous based anaesthesia using fentanyl midazolam 1 mg 25 mg dosage <NUM> ml kg h and ketamine midazolam 250 mg 25 mg dosage <NUM> ml kg h respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique enflurane mean concentration <NUM> vol <EOS>
<SOS> in three groups of patients each n 15 undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital 1 <NUM> mg followed by succinylcholine 1 5 mg kg to facilitate intubation <EOS>
<SOS> for the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis and they were artifically ventilated with n2o o2 60 40 to normal end expiratory co2 concentrations <EOS>
<SOS> no anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility <EOS>
<SOS> in order to determine gastro intestinal motility the h2 exhalation test was used <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose <NUM> g lactulose in <NUM> ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation <EOS>
<SOS> lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon and h2 is released taken up by the vascular system and exhaled <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively patients were asked to exhale into a 20 ml syringe every <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> the content was analysed for hydrogen ppm using an electrochemical sensor gmi exhaled hydrogen monitor <EOS>
<SOS> from the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration compared to the preoperative value gastro coecal transit time was computed <EOS>
<SOS> all three groups of patients were comparable in age height and body weight <EOS>
<SOS> also the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups <EOS>
<SOS> mean gastro coecal transit time was <NUM> <NUM> sd min following enflurane <NUM> <NUM> sd min following fentanyl midazolam and <NUM> <NUM> sd min following ketamine midazolam anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the gastro intestinal inhibition after the opioid based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged p0 001 kruskal wallis test <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significance between patients after ketamine based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic <EOS>
<SOS> when using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid gastro intestinal inhibition especially in patients prone to have constipation is likely to develop postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> in classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the icu the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid related gastrointestinal motility <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of opioid related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study <NUM> patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb <EOS>
<SOS> all sonograms were obtained in four planes using a <NUM> mhz transducer <EOS>
<SOS> the distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy <EOS>
<SOS> at an average of <NUM> <MOB> days after the beginning of the distraction echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction <EOS>
<SOS> radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of <NUM> days after the start of the distraction <EOS>
<SOS> exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening <EOS>
<SOS> bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> a rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped <EOS>
<SOS> with increasing cortication of the regenerate bone sonograms showed a hyper reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction measuring the length of the distraction gap and detecting early bone healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs <EOS>
<SOS> the interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> during a 1 year period patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor <EOS>
<SOS> also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ent specialist and actual referral to our department <EOS>
<SOS> we then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> it was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter median <NUM> weeks than that of patients who first went to their family doctors median <NUM> weeks p0 02 <EOS>
<SOS> the latter then took an additional <NUM> weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist <EOS>
<SOS> referral from the ent specialist to our department took another <NUM> weeks as well as our staging and pre therapeutic management <EOS>
<SOS> our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy <EOS>
<SOS> tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier p<MOB> or more often went directly to an ent specialist p0 002 <EOS>
<SOS> consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays <EOS>
<SOS> the present study deals with long term dimensional changes in cemented müller type total hip endoprostheses <EOS>
<SOS> creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene <EOS>
<SOS> the total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket <EOS>
<SOS> within the first postoperative years the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about <NUM> mm per year <EOS>
<SOS> this rate diminishes after <NUM> years to an average of about <NUM> mm ceramics and <NUM> mm metal per year <EOS>
<SOS> values exceeding <NUM> mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup comprising in all <NUM> total hip prostheses <EOS>
<SOS> after an average of <NUM> months <NUM> of the prostheses with ceramic heads n 109 had a wear rate of less than <NUM> mm per year <EOS>
<SOS> using metal heads protasul 2 and protasul 10 this rate could only be measured in <NUM> n 109 of the prostheses 61 5 months <EOS>
<SOS> the combination ceramics polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal polyethylene <EOS>
<SOS> younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead <EOS>
<SOS> the so called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years <EOS>
<SOS> one finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences so called gottron is papules generalized pruritus photosensitivity and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis <EOS>
<SOS> crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination emg and histology <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis <EOS>
<SOS> the longest reported follow up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is <NUM> years however it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy also the term premyopathic dermatomyositis is proposed to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases <EOS>
<SOS> the primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor <EOS>
<SOS> making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult <EOS>
<SOS> because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamid <EOS>
<SOS> this study compares the results of the outpatient based program of the cochlear implant center ruhr with inpatient based rehabilitation which is almost exclusively performed in germany <EOS>
<SOS> the department of otorhinolaryngology at the university of essen in germany provided <NUM> patients with either 22 or 24 channel nucleus cochlear implants from march <NUM> to july <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> almost all patients n 49 were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside germany <EOS>
<SOS> syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous constant and reproducible flow <EOS>
<SOS> for early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit <EOS>
<SOS> the sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate type specific cut off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system <EOS>
<SOS> the sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard <EOS>
<SOS> methods six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system <EOS>
<SOS> first the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10 <NUM> and <NUM> ml h were measured <EOS>
<SOS> then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post occlusion were assessed using a basic infusion system syringe single infusion set <EOS>
<SOS> finally several alterations to the system like extension tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured <EOS>
<SOS> results because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates <EOS>
<SOS> predictably there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate <EOS>
<SOS> using the basic infusion system alarm delays between <NUM> s and <NUM> min were measured <EOS>
<SOS> in two of the tested syringe drivers a pressure release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm which prevented bolus application <EOS>
<SOS> in the other devices release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0 5 7 ml <EOS>
<SOS> variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume <EOS>
<SOS> tap batteries parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system however caused marked increase in both alarm delay 107 and bolus volume 147 <EOS>
<SOS> discussion unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers <EOS>
<SOS> while applying highly potent drugs the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure <EOS>
<SOS> a further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume <EOS>
<SOS> because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory it is rarely used <EOS>
<SOS> however minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous k wire pinning are being increasingly used <EOS>
<SOS> a justified indication for the use of k wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short and long term anatomic and functional results <EOS>
<SOS> short term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful <EOS>
<SOS> reports on plaster free functional treatment after k wire pinning have been published <EOS>
<SOS> the indications therefore need to be further specified <EOS>
<SOS> follow up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in k wire stabilization and good to very good results in 75 of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare <EOS>
<SOS> rapid proliferating burkitt is lymphomas could mimic acute diseases <EOS>
<SOS> due to the extreme chemosensitivity the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology <EOS>
<SOS> initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease <EOS>
<SOS> in any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> wet autoclaving is a simple reliable and time effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material <EOS>
<SOS> both routine diagnostic e g oestrogen and progesterone receptors cytoskeletal proteins and research antibodies e g various p53 antibodies mdm 2 bcl 2 mib 1 are reported to demonstrate its application <EOS>
<SOS> wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections <EOS>
<SOS> the technique has the poten tial to reliably handle up to <NUM> sections at a time without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology <EOS>
<SOS> classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone <EOS>
<SOS> in cortical bone the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation <EOS>
<SOS> direct cortical synthesis a method also known as primary bone healing serves the bone is revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing <EOS>
<SOS> thus this may also be termed necrosis healing <EOS>
<SOS> along the shaft of long bones elastic plate osteosynthesis a biological method is safer than and superior to the rigid technique <EOS>
<SOS> this even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible <EOS>
<SOS> elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least <NUM> <NUM> holes i e <EOS>
<SOS> as long as possible without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate <EOS>
<SOS> thus there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage <EOS>
<SOS> the fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out <EOS>
<SOS> the same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws tension devices or dc gliding holes and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture is fissure <EOS>
<SOS> periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined <EOS>
<SOS> healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first <NUM> <NUM> weeks out of the periost soft tissue combination <EOS>
<SOS> histomorphological investigation dates the first woven bone bridges between the fragments to <NUM> weeks subsequent to the accident <EOS>
<SOS> in göttingen university trauma centre <NUM> fractures have been attended to over <NUM> years using this technique <EOS>
<SOS> despite considerable soft tissue damage no delayed bone healing pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> the risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods too short a flexible stretch and insufficient anchorage of the screws <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100 certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography <EOS>
<SOS> a correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner <EOS>
<SOS> both methods are available throughout germany <EOS>
<SOS> although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive <EOS>
<SOS> phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified <EOS>
<SOS> this applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined <EOS>
<SOS> discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography <EOS>
<SOS> in many institutions both methods are used in a golden partnership in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records <EOS>
<SOS> for frequent ventricular ectopic beats currently reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> this study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients <EOS>
<SOS> catheter ablation was performed in <NUM> patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats <EOS>
<SOS> the site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping earliest endocardial activation time and unipolar mapping <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients a new non contact mapping was additionally performed <EOS>
<SOS> the ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in <NUM> and in the left ventricle in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49 65 patients 75 <EOS>
<SOS> during a mean follow up of <NUM> <NUM> months <NUM> of <NUM> successful ablated patients 18 had a recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity <EOS>
<SOS> it may therefore be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity <EOS>
<SOS> injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> after healing of bone and soft tissue damage posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist <EOS>

<SOS> in the absence of coronary artery stenosis the patient was treated conservatively with an ace inhibitor lisinoprile <NUM> mg day under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin <EOS>
<SOS> with this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated in <NUM> children mean <NUM> years the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction <EOS>

<SOS> in <NUM> patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area the electrolyte concentrations ph and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated <EOS>
<SOS> the main cations identified were sodium 134 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mmol l and potassium <NUM> 37 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mmol l and as anions chloride 183 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mmol l and bicarbonate 10 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mmol l <EOS>
<SOS> the ph value of the pus liquid was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mm hg whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> mm hg <EOS>
<SOS> both pressure types show time dependent pressure curves <EOS>
<SOS> with time the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases whereas the osmotic pressure decreases <EOS>
<SOS> there was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows <EOS>
<SOS> after penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells <EOS>
<SOS> destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity <EOS>
<SOS> the inwards directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area <EOS>
<SOS> internal mammary artery ima bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> this study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the ima graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia <EOS>
<SOS> twenty five patients with multi vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the ima as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood cardioplegic <NUM> arrest <EOS>
<SOS> after unclamping the aorta and ima graft the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion <EOS>
<SOS> a sufficient ima graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature the cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side <EOS>

<SOS> introduction we report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients <EOS>
<SOS> the laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature <EOS>
<SOS> material and methods since 1993 a total of <NUM> patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy in most cases via a transperitoneal approach was performed and in <NUM> patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision <EOS>
<SOS> clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups <EOS>
<SOS> results there were no differences in terms of operative results operative time pre and postoperative hemoglobin between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups <EOS>
<SOS> patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss transfusion rate analgesic consumption hospital stay and convalescence <EOS>
<SOS> these advantages were not related to patient age <EOS>
<SOS> the complication rate was comparable for both groups however both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality rate within the first <NUM> days after nephrectomy was 1 7 in the open nephrectomy group <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate when compared to open nephrectomy <EOS>
<SOS> in terms of postoperative parameters patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages <EOS>
<SOS> especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and therefore the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the vast majority of adder bites among children in germany is caused by the common viper vipera berus <EOS>

<SOS> case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing mpd <EOS>
<SOS> the authors point out that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing <EOS>
<SOS> but their development has its limits in most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic investigation can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse <EOS>
<SOS> many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years and some have already found their way into clinical routine <EOS>
<SOS> cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment <EOS>

<SOS> in long term follow up the chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> for incidents of malignant hyperthermia mh outside the hospital a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis <EOS>
<SOS> as a result there are no statistical data in this field and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published <EOS>
<SOS> the case described in this report is a proved example of a non anesthesia related triggering of mh in a 21 year old man who had had an anesthetic induced mh manifestation in childhood which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test <EOS>
<SOS> after visiting a restaurant he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol 2 9permil <EOS>
<SOS> the first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization <EOS>
<SOS> after admission the patient showed a full blown mh episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy <EOS>
<SOS> suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral excessive alcohol consumption over heating mental stress as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances <EOS>
<SOS> the case demonstrates again that an mh attack might be triggered under certain non anaesthesia related situations <EOS>

<SOS> it was the aim of weekly conferences held in israel in <NUM> and 1996 to explore its repercussions on current behaviour <EOS>
<SOS> the topic was the past in the present <EOS>
<SOS> the participants were israelis and germans the staff international <EOS>
<SOS> the method used was the application of the group relations conference specially devised for these conferences <EOS>
<SOS> the leadership was in the hands of eric j miller director of the group relations program at the tavistock institute of human relations in london where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today <EOS>
<SOS> it is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings <EOS>
<SOS> the task which had been put to the participants was as follows to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> this was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to <EOS>
<SOS> there were moments when fantasy and reality got confused accompanied by intense feelings <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported <EOS>
<SOS> all cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed department of bone pathology of the university of hamburg since <NUM> were registered in uniform fashion <EOS>
<SOS> adapting the system to state of the art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment <EOS>
<SOS> this could not be accomplished by university resources alone but only in cooperation with other research funds <EOS>
<SOS> now <NUM> <NUM> cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed <EOS>
<SOS> background and purpose in germany 750 00 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24 48 months <EOS>
<SOS> however the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening <EOS>
<SOS> the fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors <EOS>
<SOS> a fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0 4 ala solution for <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> this topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization <EOS>
<SOS> the red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation <EOS>
<SOS> in our study on <NUM> patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity 96 of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise <EOS>
<SOS> however many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding <EOS>
<SOS> it was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce ppix after ala incubation which leads to false positive findings <EOS>
<SOS> reduction of the false positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction <EOS>
<SOS> this improves the reliability of a fluorescence guided biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> however suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method <EOS>
<SOS> autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers <EOS>
<SOS> based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation <EOS>
<SOS> increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude <EOS>
<SOS> automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds <EOS>
<SOS> thus changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool <EOS>
<SOS> this case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture <EOS>
<SOS> the indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely <EOS>
<SOS> successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events <EOS>

<SOS> tissue engineering offers the possibility to fabricate living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials <EOS>
<SOS> pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and subcultured ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors <EOS>
<SOS> the fabrication of bone and cartilage constructs their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing <EOS>

<SOS> the use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction donor site morbidity of autologous grafts immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results <EOS>
<SOS> 16 patients 7 female <NUM> male average age <NUM> years 24 72 years were treated for stage ii to ii posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction tendon reconstruction 15 tendon transfer 8 deltoid ligament repair 10 <EOS>
<SOS> when the aofas ankle hindfoot rating scale was applied these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of <NUM> to a mean postoperative value of <NUM> after a mean follow up of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> in all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted <EOS>
<SOS> in one case a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after <NUM> months due to painful degenerative joint disease <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch reduction of forefoot abduction and restored arch height <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were able to fully weight bear the operated foot and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result <EOS>
<SOS> in the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage ii to ii as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function <EOS>
<SOS> by the update of §24 a of the german road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment <EOS>
<SOS> the only requisite is the detection of certain drugs metabolites in a blood sample <EOS>
<SOS> therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood serum <EOS>
<SOS> the new mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay mtp eia is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix <EOS>
<SOS> for an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from mahsan mtp eia and the routinely used abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay fpia with a batch of routine serum samples <EOS>
<SOS> for the mtp eias we used the cut off recommendations of the supplier cannabinoids <NUM> ng ml opiates <NUM> ng ml <EOS>
<SOS> for the abbott fpias the serum samples had to be pretreated deproteinization with acetone and appropriate cut offs were defined by our investigations cannabinoids <NUM> ng ml opiates <NUM> ng ml <EOS>
<SOS> out of <NUM> samples screened for cannabinoids 42 were positive with gc ms and 18 from <NUM> samples were positive for opiates <EOS>
<SOS> the abbott cannabinoid fpia gave false negative results in 23 of gc ms positive cases and 9 false negatives for opiates while mahsan mtp eia gave no false negatives <EOS>
<SOS> each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13 of the cases and for the mtp opiate assay 2 of the positives could not be confirmed with gc ms as a result of our study the cut off values for the mtp eias have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives <EOS>
<SOS> systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in <NUM> by mihatsch <EOS>
<SOS> seven cases have been reported to date <EOS>
<SOS> we give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30 year old italian man <EOS>
<SOS> bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and less obviously in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain <EOS>
<SOS> these findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis nonspecific hepatopathy adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the patient died <NUM> years after diagnosis in septic toxic shock <EOS>
<SOS> the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> 17 of malignant melanomas n 100 investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than <NUM> mm in maximal diameter median diameter <NUM> <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> the median age of the <NUM> patients at diagnosis of small diameter melanomas was <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions although their clinical criteria differed from the classic abcds <EOS>
<SOS> 6 35 3 of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ <EOS>
<SOS> this percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of <NUM> mm in diameter or larger 38 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the remaining <NUM> small lesions were classified as invasive from clark is level i to v including all classic histogenetic types superficial spreading nodular unclassified desmoplastic <EOS>
<SOS> the median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0 76 0 23 mm <EOS>
<SOS> 7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus <EOS>
<SOS> epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of <NUM> dysplastic nevi and <NUM> spindle cell nevi <EOS>
<SOS> the technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket lens <EOS>
<SOS> mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential <EOS>
<SOS> it is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years there have been numerous reports of infections by m gordonae in immunocompromised patients <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast only four cases of skin infections by m gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published <EOS>
<SOS> we report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening <EOS>
<SOS> m gordonae was isolated by tissue culture <EOS>
<SOS> the skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months <EOS>
<SOS> the article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> biochemical cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> it has been established that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver <EOS>
<SOS> the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear however <EOS>
<SOS> in particular one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore organ dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist <EOS>
<SOS> oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs <EOS>
<SOS> the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is however still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> the authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor specific mr contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function <EOS>
<SOS> receptor specificity of mr contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor specific carriers to ligands <EOS>
<SOS> this concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity <EOS>
<SOS> specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor organ contrast and therefore tumor detection <EOS>
<SOS> specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function <EOS>
<SOS> future design concepts of novel mr contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs ovaries adrenal glands lymph nodes etc <EOS>
<SOS> with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers <EOS>
<SOS> elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with down syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> it is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers <EOS>
<SOS> this may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a 40 year old woman with down is syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time <EOS>
<SOS> the position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot <EOS>
<SOS> medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot <EOS>
<SOS> varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus as in residual clubfoot however causes supination and adduction of the forefoot <EOS>
<SOS> repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot <EOS>
<SOS> a large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones <EOS>
<SOS> the most popular ones are dwyer is osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans <EOS>
<SOS> indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail <EOS>
<SOS> the closing wedge osteotomy according to dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet <EOS>
<SOS> in clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases an osteotomy according to mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable <EOS>
<SOS> in flat and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans can be indicated especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> if these procedures are carried out carefully they have low complications rates <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and august 1998 <NUM> patients with <NUM> chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap <EOS>
<SOS> one patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection <EOS>
<SOS> the average duration of infection was <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the patients had undergone an average of <NUM> operations <EOS>
<SOS> up to now there was no recurrent infection controlled by clinical investigation ultrasound and laboratory findings in all <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> follow up investigation occured <NUM> years <MOB> after flap transfer <EOS>
<SOS> the flap is easy to harvest <EOS>
<SOS> he has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation <EOS>
<SOS> the functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal <EOS>
<SOS> that vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region <EOS>
<SOS> information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and therefore new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics <EOS>
<SOS> a german law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies <EOS>
<SOS> all intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases <EOS>
<SOS> financial support and political work is therefore needed <EOS>
<SOS> to optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> this includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials human placenta and the rat model <EOS>
<SOS> the most important role in this concept is played by the placenta <EOS>
<SOS> it supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> as to availability handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept <EOS>
<SOS> since manfred bleuler is description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over <NUM> years ago debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset <EOS>
<SOS> as this review shows this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now <EOS>
<SOS> it must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since manfred bleuler is comprehensive contribution nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically <EOS>
<SOS> the reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far <EOS>
<SOS> definition of the problem in parallel with public and philosophical discussions there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics <EOS>
<SOS> in this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements <EOS>
<SOS> arguments a short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms <EOS>
<SOS> the second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps the level of principles the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences <EOS>
<SOS> the third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition the ethics of a good life and death focusing on the central question how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion it would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life especially the meaning of dignity autonomy and inviolability of human life and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia <EOS>
<SOS> in this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death <EOS>
<SOS> multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> despite the combination of all three therapeutic options there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain <EOS>
<SOS> recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures <EOS>
<SOS> inactivation of the gene may be an <NUM> important determinant of the efficiacy of today is multimodal therapy protocols <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> from all patients biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53 <EOS>
<SOS> after radiation treatment <NUM> patients 57 showed a complete response <NUM> patients 43 only showed a partial response or did not respond at all <EOS>
<SOS> among the responders 82 of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive whereas among the nonresponders only 56 of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in our study detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> the human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components <EOS>
<SOS> in different joint diseases it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair <EOS>
<SOS> in tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids in the synovial fluid and then in the blood and the urin where they can be detected <EOS>
<SOS> the quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids <EOS>
<SOS> the research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis the disease severity rather than its presence or absence the prognosis and the response to therapy <EOS>
<SOS> they should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level <EOS>
<SOS> the specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> the research in this area is still in the early stages with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s <EOS>
<SOS> axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm <EOS>
<SOS> in our hospital with many trainees in anaesthesia only <NUM> <NUM> axillary blocks per year are performed by about <NUM> colleagues <EOS>
<SOS> this implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist <EOS>
<SOS> the present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions <EOS>
<SOS> we used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist is experience in this technique <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we examined other factors involved in the success of the block <EOS>
<SOS> the study included <NUM> patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity all received an axillary block <EOS>
<SOS> we used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1 without adrenaline <EOS>
<SOS> the following parameters were recorded the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist the minimal current required for nerve stimulation the dose of local anaesthetic the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery the duration of surgery and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10 20 and <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method no blockade analgesia anaesthesia motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms no blockade paresis paralysis <EOS>
<SOS> data were analyzed using the mann whitney test with p0 05 considered statistically significant <EOS>
<SOS> of the <NUM> blocks <NUM> 85 were successful <NUM> 15 failed and the patients required general anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after 70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> we found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block <EOS>
<SOS> the minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was <NUM> ma and differed significantly from the value of <NUM> ma in the failure group table 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group 5 9 vs <NUM> mg kg <EOS>
<SOS> complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median ulnar and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis fig <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of complete sensory blockade anaesthesia had increased by 21 9 between the 20th and 30th min <EOS>
<SOS> complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade fig <EOS>
<SOS> using the method of electrostimulation the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it <EOS>
<SOS> prior to injection of the local anaesthetic the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to 0 5 ma <EOS>
<SOS> the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than <NUM> min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved <EOS>
<SOS> the dose of mepivacaine should be no less than <NUM> mg kg body weight <EOS>
<SOS> vascular endothelial growth factor vegf was discovered <NUM> years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels <EOS>
<SOS> numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults <EOS>
<SOS> it is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia <EOS>
<SOS> these properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> five vegf forms of <NUM> to <NUM> amino acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing <EOS>
<SOS> cells expressing vegf usually express several forms simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> vegf121 does not contain exons <NUM> and <NUM> of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability <EOS>
<SOS> however this form is fully <NUM> active as an inducer of angiogenesis and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent <EOS>
<SOS> exon <NUM> and <NUM> contain <NUM> independent heparin binding domains <EOS>
<SOS> the vegf form containing exon <NUM> vegf165 and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon <NUM> vegf145 display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many vegf forms are required <EOS>
<SOS> it was found that vegf121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast vegf145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly <EOS>
<SOS> when the receptor binding properties of vegf121 and vegf165 were compared it was found that vegf165 binds to a class of vegf receptors that is not recognized by vegf121 <EOS>
<SOS> these receptors are encoded by the neuropilin 1 gene and we have recently found that the related neuropilin 2 gene also encodes a vegf165 receptor <EOS>
<SOS> we have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another vegf receptor vegfr 1 <EOS>
<SOS> however the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem <EOS>
<SOS> the healing of wounds by secondary <NUM> intention is a simple method to close <NUM> operative defects <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the <NUM> defect <EOS>
<SOS> best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave <NUM> geometry and when the defect lies <NUM> symmetrically at the interface of two <NUM> anatomic subunits <EOS>
<SOS> partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric <NUM> defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention <EOS>
<SOS> this simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports <EOS>
<SOS> background acute infectious mononucleosis im is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of ebv infected immortalised b cells and poly oligoclonal cytotoxic t cells which are to a high percentage ebv specific <EOS>
<SOS> in b cells ebv infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of ebv nuclear antigens 1 6 ebna1 6 and membrane antigens 1 2a and 2b lmp1 lmp2a and lmp2b <EOS>
<SOS> expression of these ebv latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected b cells <EOS>
<SOS> here we examined if also lytic ebv genes i e <EOS>
<SOS> bzlf1 which are associated with a productive ebv infection are expressed during im <EOS>
<SOS> arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy arvcm is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia vt and sudden death <EOS>
<SOS> treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death <EOS>
<SOS> in a minority of patients with progressive arvcm and clinical signs of heart failure pharmacological treatment with vasodilators diuretics and digitalis may be required <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound us computed tomography ct and single photon emission computed tomography spect as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth <EOS>
<SOS> the typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise <EOS>
<SOS> ocular muscle involvement with ptosis in 50 and diplopia in 25 are the most common initial signs <EOS>
<SOS> the disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles generalized myasthenia <EOS>
<SOS> the muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia <EOS>
<SOS> since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> also a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability <EOS>
<SOS> the injection of edrophonium tensilon the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation decrement test and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia <EOS>
<SOS> the edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases <EOS>
<SOS> antibodies are present in 50 of ocular myasthenia and in 80 90 of the generalized form <EOS>
<SOS> the lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome other neuromuscular diseases mitochondrial diseases diseases of the cranial nerves botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan tages <EOS>
<SOS> they offer a great deal of innovative ideas <EOS>
<SOS> best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures <EOS>
<SOS> when using 2 7 mm polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1 8 mm k wires <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective and randomised study with two years follow up including <NUM> radial head fractures showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants <EOS>
<SOS> for this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended <EOS>
<SOS> despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant <EOS>
<SOS> orien truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results newetheless resorption was extremely late within <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> the potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis <EOS>
<SOS> autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline like cartilage <EOS>
<SOS> outcome studies with a follow up from 2 10 years show in up to <NUM> good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and <NUM> for the patella <EOS>
<SOS> mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage <EOS>
<SOS> the available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well trained surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels <EOS>
<SOS> according to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process the clinical presentation and the histological appearance different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished <EOS>
<SOS> primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs malignancy or infection <EOS>
<SOS> panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic hepatitis b and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic hepatitis c are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections <EOS>
<SOS> however these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis <EOS>
<SOS> patients infected by hiv frequently suffer from vasculitis which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation <EOS>
<SOS> in numerous case reports various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction <EOS>
<SOS> immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient is immune system <EOS>
<SOS> after successful treatment of the infection the vasculitis usually subsides <EOS>
<SOS> therefore all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection <EOS>
<SOS> to calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre and postoperative computed tomographies of <NUM> patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by uss universal spine system <EOS>
<SOS> our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> we found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area asp preoperatively <NUM> postop <EOS>
<SOS> 80 and midsagittal diameter msd preop <EOS>
<SOS> 10 of <NUM> patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit no neurological deterioration occured <EOS>
<SOS> fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise 52 and less midsagittal diameter msd compromise <NUM> than those without 40 or <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> there was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit <EOS>
<SOS> below l <NUM> the spinal canal is greater than between th <NUM> and l 1 so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated <EOS>
<SOS> in case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded <EOS>
<SOS> in fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis <EOS>
<SOS> in common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury <EOS>
<SOS> an exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy <EOS>
<SOS> especially the correct decision about the therapy operative vs conservative including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> these patients should be transferred to a specialised centre <EOS>
<SOS> the intensity of dna degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was the investigation of dna degradation over fixation times of up to <NUM> days in different tissues muscle brain liver bone and with different formalin concentration 2 <NUM> <NUM> unbuffered <EOS>
<SOS> an additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using pcr analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the smallest amounts of dna were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone <EOS>
<SOS> the amount of dna that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration while at the same time dna degradation increased <EOS>
<SOS> with the pcr vntr system humth 01 all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration <EOS>
<SOS> the draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata acne fulminans acne inversa rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans pyoderma faciale <EOS>
<SOS> it is most common on the face especially in the nasolabial folds and on the neck below the mandibular line <EOS>
<SOS> clinically it is an elongated 2 5 cm long elevated periodically inflamed lesion which sporadically discharges pus <EOS>
<SOS> the lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression <EOS>
<SOS> histopathologically it consists of elaborate epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points <EOS>
<SOS> it contains corneocytes hairs bacteria serum inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas <EOS>
<SOS> a surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied <EOS>
<SOS> intralesional corticosteroid injection cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective <EOS>
<SOS> sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst <EOS>
<SOS> a thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies <EOS>
<SOS> instead it is a soft tissue disease where the c8 and t1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura <EOS>
<SOS> thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> if surgery is recommended it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib <EOS>
<SOS> transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications <EOS>
<SOS> among these brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one <EOS>
<SOS> objective the objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non cancer pain in germany and austria <EOS>
<SOS> methods in june <NUM> a questionnaire was sent to <NUM> german and austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked <EOS>
<SOS> results the response rate was 23 <EOS>
<SOS> the data show that 78 of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain <EOS>
<SOS> local anaesthetics are used by 85 of these anaesthesiologists followed by morphine 72 clonidine 48 buprenorphine 34 baclofen 20 fentanyl 13 and sufentanil 10 <EOS>
<SOS> for most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used again followed by opioids und clonidine <EOS>
<SOS> in the <NUM> answering pain clinics <MOB> epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year <EOS>
<SOS> discussion epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in germany and austria either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment <EOS>
<SOS> for some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking <EOS>
<SOS> the use of these substances has to be considered very carefully <EOS>
<SOS> intraartial conduction disturbances iacd are the known substrate of re entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy <EOS>
<SOS> signs of iacd can be missed on the standard ecg and signal averaged sa p wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological eps properties of atrial myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing are known to electrophysiologists but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice and raa based pacing modes remain standard even for pts <EOS>
<SOS> we examined and compared eps effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools iegm obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system via telemetry and time domain analysis of sa p wave in <NUM> pts <EOS>
<SOS> with bia pacing system implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and iacd <EOS>
<SOS> the results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently raa pacing aggravates iacd in comparison to sinus rhythm the effects of cs pacing is less visible <EOS>
<SOS> bia pacing normalises all atrial activation times <EOS>
<SOS> the normalisation of sa p wave duration reduction of sa p wave dispersion increasing of rms <NUM> and decreasing of las <NUM> and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts <EOS>
<SOS> indicates beneficial effects of bia pacing in pts <EOS>
<SOS> with iacd in comparison to sinus rhythm and raa pacing <EOS>
<SOS> unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing in patients with iacd indicates suitability the need for alternative resynchronising atrial pacing modes <EOS>
<SOS> time domain analysis of sa p wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non invasive evaluation of eps effects of different modes of atrial pacing <EOS>
<SOS> background we report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> on account of the spatial distance there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> however in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation use of the laryngeal mask airway bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported <EOS>
<SOS> the endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units <EOS>
<SOS> manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits based on the described techniques from ciaglia cook set as well as from griggs portex set <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this investigation was to show the advantages disadvantages costs and risks of the puncture tracheostomy and to make a comparison using conventional procedures <EOS>
<SOS> chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children adolescents and adults but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical <EOS>
<SOS> pain and swelling are the main symptoms painless masses are rare <EOS>
<SOS> in children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic abacterial osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> in adults the clavicles or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints but the long bones are rarely involved <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory findings are non specific but important for the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the sedimentation rate and c reactive protein might be elevated <EOS>
<SOS> the x ray examination shows osteolytic sclerotic or mixed bony changes and in case of a diaphyseal involvement onionskinlike periosteal bone formation may be present suggesting a malignant process <EOS>
<SOS> in late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest <EOS>
<SOS> uni or multifocal lesions can be detected by bonescan as can asymptomatic lesions <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium dpta enhancement in t1 weighted images <EOS>
<SOS> in early stages of the disease granulocytes microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology <EOS>
<SOS> in intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically <EOS>
<SOS> in chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis all clinical radiological and histological findings as well as negative bacteriological cultures are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made <EOS>
<SOS> the disease may be uni or multifocal and new bone lesions may occur over time as well as skin manifestations which can be found years before or after bone involvement <EOS>
<SOS> the association with dermatological diseases and or synovitis led to the acronym sapho syndrome synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> for the treatment non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief reduction of swelling and dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective <EOS>
<SOS> major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years <EOS>
<SOS> a woman with severe stiff man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation <EOS>
<SOS> the blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5 10 min <EOS>
<SOS> this rhythm was also maintained after relaxation <EOS>
<SOS> however the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen <EOS>
<SOS> it is speculated that spinal gabaergic mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer n 113 pt1 3 pn0 1 pm0 r0 were investigated the prognostic value was compared with pt and pn stage grading and laurén is tumor classification with cox is multivariate regression model <EOS>
<SOS> sarcoid like lesions were found in <NUM> of the cases n 113 <EOS>
<SOS> statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present they were independent of pt stage histological tumor type tumor grading and the clinical course of disease <EOS>
<SOS> microcarcinosis defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction was revealed by immunohistochemistry in <NUM> of pn0 cases the presence of <NUM> or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over <NUM> of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value <EOS>
<SOS> in microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value <EOS>
<SOS> in pn1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in <NUM> and had no additional prognostic value <EOS>
<SOS> microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis <EOS>

<SOS> the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0 2 to 4 9 <EOS>
<SOS> ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease where vessel ectasia and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a <NUM> year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> we performed a ptca and stent implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery <EOS>
<SOS> after the procedure the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris <EOS>
<SOS> a control angiography will be performed six months later <EOS>
<SOS> tmlr transmyocardial laser revascularization is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in europe since <NUM> that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber <EOS>
<SOS> goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels <EOS>
<SOS> we examined hearts of <NUM> patients who died during the first <NUM> days after tmlr <EOS>
<SOS> channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope <EOS>
<SOS> laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about <NUM> mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about <NUM> µm thick <EOS>
<SOS> despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks <EOS>
<SOS> open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> these channels communicate with intramural vessels but in no instance with chamber lumen <EOS>
<SOS> our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood <EOS>
<SOS> additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> however our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased <EOS>
<SOS> if similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after tmlr remains open <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent miscarriages are like sporadically occurring miscarriage often approx <EOS>
<SOS> 50 due to chromosomal aberrations <EOS>
<SOS> an undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances <EOS>
<SOS> the basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them <EOS>
<SOS> the initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal hla systems hla sharing is most likely incorrect <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes <EOS>
<SOS> several placebo controlled studies have been performed <EOS>
<SOS> due to the small number of cases results were not significant <EOS>
<SOS> a metaanalysis of all studies however proves significant effects of the active immune therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins ivig <EOS>
<SOS> this therapy however is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in a metaanalysis of all published results ivig was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after <NUM> or more consecutive abortions after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions <EOS>
<SOS> it appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy <EOS>
<SOS> athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate alternative concepts are not available <EOS>
<SOS> hence new therapeutic approaches are also not available <EOS>
<SOS> the first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available <EOS>
<SOS> our new tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss snhl is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid hearing losses during implantation the tübingen piezotransducer will be 1 fixed to the mastoid cavity and 2 positioned to one of the ossicular target points <EOS>
<SOS> this can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity <EOS>
<SOS> the manipulator weights <NUM> g with four degrees of freedom it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer is probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the main advantages of the present micromanipulator are 1 easy handling during surgery 2 the transducer is precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom and 3 the transducer is stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position <EOS>
<SOS> following integrated safety as the leading principle ossicular or inner ear injuries caused e g by the patient is head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon are minimized <EOS>
<SOS> the micromanipulator is as it were the surgeon is vibration free artificial hand <EOS>
<SOS> the manipulator is development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in <NUM> human temporal bones are shown in detail <EOS>
<SOS> while coupling the transducer to the body of the incus transducer microphone and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76 of all mastoid cavities without protrusion <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus the protrusion free implantation rate of the above mentioned three implant modules is 78 <EOS>
<SOS> the role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> computed tomography ct remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims <EOS>
<SOS> although magnetic resonance imaging mr has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than ct due to the ease and speed of ct and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with ct than with mr mean that mr is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work up <EOS>
<SOS> recent mr techniques such as flair or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of mr in head trauma <EOS>

<SOS> injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint <EOS>
<SOS> today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics based on our experiences and data from the international literature <EOS>
<SOS> a further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques <EOS>
<SOS> we also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results <EOS>
<SOS> sevoflurane like all currently used volatile anaesthetics is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents <EOS>
<SOS> the most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as compound a <EOS>
<SOS> compound a is nephrotoxic in rats and at higher doses in nonhuman primates causing proximal tubular necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> there has been much interest in the potential for compound a toxicity in humans <EOS>
<SOS> inhaled compound a concentrations are greatest at low flow rates high sevoflurane concentrations warmer absorbent barium hydroxide vs soda lime and drier absorbent <EOS>
<SOS> typical inspired compound a concentrations during low flow and closed circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8 24 and 20 32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime respectively <EOS>
<SOS> renal effects of compound a production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers using standard creatinine clearance serum bun and creatinine and experimental urine excretion of protein glucose nag gst aap markers of renal function <EOS>
<SOS> investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low flow sevoflurane low flow isoflurane or high flow sevoflurane <EOS>
<SOS> there have been no case reports of compound a associated renal injury in humans <EOS>
<SOS> in volunteers one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanism of compound a nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans <EOS>
<SOS> in the report of the <NUM> world health federation international society and federation of cardiology whf isfc task force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated <EOS>

<SOS> we report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs <EOS>
<SOS> recurrent csf rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery <EOS>

<SOS> introduction interleukin 12 p70 il 12 p70 is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain p40 and a light chain p35 <EOS>
<SOS> contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of il 12 after polytrauma <EOS>
<SOS> methods we daily analyzed systemic concentrations of il 12 in polytrauma patients n 37 mean iss 33 9 in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by elisa <EOS>
<SOS> patients were divided according to their mean il 12 levels into those with elevated il 12 group 1 n 7 those with decreased il 12 group 2 n 4 and those with il 12 in the normal range group 3 n 26 <EOS>
<SOS> results patients in group <NUM> revealed elevated levels of il 12 up to p70 <NUM> pg ml and p40 <NUM> pg ml <EOS>
<SOS> the common clinical feature of group <NUM> was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia 85 survivors <EOS>
<SOS> patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma group 3 showed normal il 12 values <EOS>
<SOS> patients with decreased il 12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed <EOS>
<SOS> the groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit in tiss in mods score and in respiratory ratio but not in iss mean crp values and leukocyte counts <EOS>
<SOS> correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered il 12 values and clinical parameters with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and iss r <MOB> or mods score r <MOB> in group <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions after major injuries there is no overall suppression of il 12 formation <EOS>
<SOS> patients with normal or elevated il 12 levels belong mainly to the survivors whereas patients with decreased il 12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi organ failure <EOS>
<SOS> this article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch mainly in forward flexion of the arm <EOS>
<SOS> different stages of impingement syndrome are described <EOS>
<SOS> stage i relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon <EOS>
<SOS> stage ii is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis as well as tendinopathy <EOS>
<SOS> in stage ii there is a tear of the rotator cuff <EOS>
<SOS> moreover calcifying tendinitis fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> imaging is important for the exact diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> they may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity subacromial spurs and form anomalies of the acromion <EOS>
<SOS> they are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis fractures and neoplasm <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors <EOS>
<SOS> however there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears <EOS>
<SOS> its usefulness has therefore been questioned <EOS>
<SOS> mr imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures <EOS>
<SOS> several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings such as tendinopathy versus partial tears may be difficult with mr imaging <EOS>
<SOS> however reproducibility for full thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography <EOS>
<SOS> moreover specificity appears to be superior to sonography <EOS>
<SOS> mr arthrography is not universally accepted <EOS>
<SOS> however it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning <EOS>
<SOS> standard arthrography and ct have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff <EOS>
<SOS> gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type according to ming occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only <EOS>
<SOS> over the past <NUM> years we have observed <NUM> cases of this tumour type accounting for <NUM> of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> macroscopically they were classified as borrmann iv or ii while histologically most of them were well differentiated <EOS>
<SOS> histologically these tumours retained the pre existing structures of the stomach most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels <EOS>
<SOS> all but <NUM> cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes often small showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour <EOS>
<SOS> significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in <NUM> of <NUM> women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in <NUM> of <NUM> patients in whom billroth ii operation had been performed <EOS>
<SOS> the mean survival time of <NUM> patients was <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification <EOS>
<SOS> close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary and intraoperative assessment of the tumour including frozen section of necessary in particular is of the outmost importance <EOS>
<SOS> one rare case of so called massive idiopathic osteolysis gorham stout is presented <EOS>
<SOS> in a 77 year old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within <NUM> month following trauma <EOS>
<SOS> as a histologic cause for the osteolysis a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa especially intracortically was observed <EOS>
<SOS> the course and the clinical findings are described and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature <EOS>

<SOS> in this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client centered therapy is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue <EOS>
<SOS> if one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts then a comprehensive status diagnosis using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory led client centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> client centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which assumed diagnoses embedded in the therapist is empathic knowledge are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in the examination of reversible segmental articular hypomobile dysfunction blockage of the spine we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement barrier <EOS>
<SOS> this is the main finding to diagnose segmental articular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end <EOS>
<SOS> in contrary the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction i e restriction of joint facet gliding <EOS>
<SOS> multiple intra and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations <EOS>
<SOS> in the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes <EOS>
<SOS> except for the frequently occurring warthin tumours primary salivary gland tumours which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes are rare <EOS>
<SOS> examples of these are adenomas pleomorphic adenoma basal cell adenoma and carcinomas acinic cell carcinoma mucoepidermoid carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> three of our own observations sebaceous lymphadenoma acinic cell carcinoma mucoepidermoid carcinoma are analysed <EOS>
<SOS> the condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour free and that no other occult carcinoma is present <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed <EOS>
<SOS> elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to determine whether <NUM> hour patch testing with 0 5 sodium lauryl sulphate sls could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test art a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide <EOS>
<SOS> after having given informed consent <NUM> patients age range from <NUM> to <NUM> years with an active irritant contact dermatitis icd <NUM> patients in whom icd had cleared as well as <NUM> healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested <EOS>
<SOS> the skin responses to sls were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss tewl as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity <EOS>
<SOS> sls significantly increased the erythema scores and tewl in patients with healed icd and the increase of tewl was even more pronounced in patients with active icd <EOS>
<SOS> by contrast a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active icd only but not in patients with healed icd <EOS>
<SOS> the data obtained indicate that the sls test unlike art may provide a non invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function <EOS>
<SOS> however because of the relatively high interindividual variation a cut clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test <EOS>

<SOS> introduction the correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation prk while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy <EOS>
<SOS> experience has shown that cataract surgery using modern tunnel techniques with self healing incisions results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair wise t incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy alk <EOS>
<SOS> an often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care is reactive acute cholecystitis <EOS>
<SOS> on account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively seven times on different days in each of <NUM> artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the results show that artificial respiration parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive 28 40 wallthickening or to a three layered wall of the gallbladder 9 40 <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of patients 9 40 we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis <EOS>
<SOS> in correlation with the clinical signs cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients <EOS>
<SOS> the preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of <NUM> patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively <EOS>
<SOS> we found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in <NUM> of these <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations even if there is no underlying cholecystitis <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings <EOS>
<SOS> osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis <EOS>
<SOS> several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone such as conventional radiography high resolution computed tomography hr ct and high resolution magnetic resonance imaging hr mri <EOS>
<SOS> the best results were obtained using high resolution tomographic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using hr mri <EOS>
<SOS> these studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion <EOS>
<SOS> combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis <EOS>
<SOS> classification of cosmetics which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists <EOS>
<SOS> their definition within the eu and the respective european directives replacing national laws step by step will be briefly presented <EOS>
<SOS> the problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discussed in detail by examples from clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> finally we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing medicinally active cosmetics and in the pharmaceutical industry towards cosmetically oriented medicinal products as part of a current life style ideology <EOS>
<SOS> in some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents <EOS>
<SOS> the decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy <EOS>
<SOS> especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases <EOS>
<SOS> this study reports of <NUM> patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness <EOS>
<SOS> we considered the location of the tear the shape and the size <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined <EOS>
<SOS> the results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not <EOS>
<SOS> the isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears <EOS>
<SOS> health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical ethical and legal problems for the physician <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions <EOS>
<SOS> barber is disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands <EOS>
<SOS> the following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands <EOS>
<SOS> such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand <EOS>
<SOS> the application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters intrathoracic blood volume and extravascular lung water <EOS>
<SOS> this technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a <NUM> or <NUM> french catheter in the femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> additionally controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used <EOS>
<SOS> hypnosis autogenic training progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation therapy and are useful techniques in psycho or behavior therapy <EOS>
<SOS> though they share some aspects with body oriented psychotherapy these relaxation techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation <EOS>
<SOS> though in details somewhat different the methodology of these techniques creates a framework in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited <EOS>
<SOS> however regular practice of the patients is requiered <EOS>
<SOS> focussed attention imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem <EOS>
<SOS> controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders e g <EOS>
<SOS> headache pain ess <EOS>
<SOS> hypertension as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders <EOS>
<SOS> as components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders e g <EOS>
<SOS> relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific based component in the treatment of psychic psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders except psychosis <EOS>
<SOS> juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in <NUM> by murray <EOS>
<SOS> major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy minor criteria include contractures osteolytic lesions and a positive family history <EOS>
<SOS> a 35 year old woman suffering from crohn is disease for <NUM> years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet as well as on her elbows and wrists <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum <EOS>
<SOS> no improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions <EOS>
<SOS> during a new attack of her crohn is disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again <EOS>
<SOS> the parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and crohn is disease as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases strongly suggest a common etiology <EOS>
<SOS> this hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature <EOS>
<SOS> the mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level <EOS>
<SOS> possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans <EOS>
<SOS> the somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex <EOS>
<SOS> changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing on one side limb amputation will result in a representational invasion of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes <EOS>
<SOS> on the other side sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb <EOS>
<SOS> plastic changes can be temporary or persistent <EOS>
<SOS> modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization <EOS>
<SOS> thus specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions <EOS>
<SOS> there have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction ami <EOS>
<SOS> however a substantial number of patients with ami who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options <EOS>
<SOS> to describe the proportions characteristics and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective maximal individual optimized therapy for acute myocardial infarction mitra trial <EOS>
<SOS> chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ specific symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> people with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections <EOS>
<SOS> history physical examination laboratory tests microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> background we perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> we assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle <EOS>
<SOS> trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims injuries and physiologic derangements <EOS>
<SOS> they are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions <EOS>
<SOS> in the pre clinical setting an effective trauma index meets the following criteria it is highly reliable with regard to identifying high and low risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> it has high face validity <EOS>
<SOS> it has high inter and intra rater reliability <EOS>
<SOS> it is easy to use and allows rapid accurate measurements <EOS>
<SOS> the most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the injury severity score iss <EOS>
<SOS> it is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents <EOS>
<SOS> the trauma score ts represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity <EOS>
<SOS> it summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions <EOS>
<SOS> the recently developed mainz emergency evaluation score mees is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs including a pain scale and has been designed as a dynamic score <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described <EOS>
<SOS> mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring <EOS>
<SOS> in addition intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions <EOS>
<SOS> thus therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible <EOS>
<SOS> the accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging for example pain as chosen in the mees must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult especially when classifying unconscious patients <EOS>
<SOS> further criticisms of the above mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim is age gender pre injury health status or the influence of alcohol or additional medication <EOS>
<SOS> moreover questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers <EOS>
<SOS> if trauma indices in pre hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed <EOS>
<SOS> resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices since e g in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore a qualitative assignment of single vital function parameters as crucial indices for a patient is condition never reflects the broad range of a patient is profile <EOS>
<SOS> many multiple trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range and the administration of analgesics or even pre hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field <EOS>
<SOS> providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care the mees has been developed as a dynamic scoring system <EOS>
<SOS> this design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine pre hospital indices do have limitations <EOS>
<SOS> the parameters unknown patient time pressure unprecise measurements lack of diagnostic facilities incomplete evaluation and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated <EOS>
<SOS> accurate prediction of outcome within early time frames is therefore not possible <EOS>
<SOS> ossification of the achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic hypoxic injury of the tendon <EOS>
<SOS> the usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma <EOS>
<SOS> we report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the achilles tendon <EOS>
<SOS> because of the radiologically occult fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by mri <EOS>
<SOS> with a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery <EOS>
<SOS> hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the alopecias represent a major health care challenge and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community <EOS>
<SOS> they may pose a vexing problem for non specialized physicians who tend to trivialize such complaints although the patient is perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought <EOS>
<SOS> perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards films and advertisements help determine the threshold for normality and what is healthy and beautiful and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care <EOS>
<SOS> patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist <EOS>
<SOS> thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser is training qualifications <EOS>
<SOS> besides manual creative and psychological aptitudes trichological competence relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required <EOS>
<SOS> to optimize the interaction between the physician hairdressers and the media more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable with success depending on full identification of the set goals qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality <EOS>
<SOS> we reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small cell lung cancer sclc which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was sclc before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two <EOS>
<SOS> two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small cell and adenocarcinomatous components and five had only adenocarcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> the interval between histological evidence of sclc and adenocarcinoma was <NUM> months 5 years <EOS>
<SOS> from the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in sclc after chemotherapy a a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy and b an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of sclc as patients with treated sclc are known to have an increased risk of non sclc <EOS>
<SOS> however therapy induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely <EOS>
<SOS> these findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of sclc to allow early and appropriate reaction to non sclc components <EOS>
<SOS> demonstration of bdv specific serum antibodies the isolation of bdv from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients and the recent demonstration of bdv antigen and bdv rna in human brain tissue strongly suggest that bdv can infect humans <EOS>
<SOS> isolation of bd virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof <EOS>
<SOS> there is still great controversy about the question of whether bdv antigen bdv rna or bdv can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not <EOS>
<SOS> overall the question of pathogenicity of bdv infection for humans is wide open <EOS>
<SOS> investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that bdv might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases <EOS>
<SOS> seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non specific but possibly pathogenic role of bdv in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and uva b phototherapy to a uva b mono phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis ad <EOS>
<SOS> the patients in the balneophototherapy group n 16 were treated with baths containing 3 5 of the synthetic salt psori sal followed immediately by uva b irradiation while the other treatment arm n 12 received uva b phototherapy alone <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant p <MOB> reduction of the scorad score from <NUM> before to <NUM> after therapy <EOS>
<SOS> no statistically significant reduction in the scorad score could be observed in the uva b phototherapy group 50 6 before to <NUM> after therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the cumulative uvb dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group 0 9 j cm2 as compared to the uva b monotherapy group 2 0 j cm2 <EOS>
<SOS> balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate <EOS>
<SOS> head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected <EOS>
<SOS> the functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient <EOS>
<SOS> background and purpose only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt pa for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published <EOS>
<SOS> wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt pa in stroke ecass and ninds did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels <EOS>
<SOS> introduction chronic pain is an individually variable experience incorporating physical psychological and social dimensions <EOS>
<SOS> chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity therefore a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies <EOS>
<SOS> it is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability <EOS>
<SOS> the traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions bankart lesion hill sachs lesion overstretching of the capsule which are caused at the time of primary dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the bankart lesion <EOS>
<SOS> the stronger the capsule the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule <EOS>
<SOS> the damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of atraumatic instability secondary lesions are normally absent <EOS>
<SOS> these instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule <EOS>
<SOS> when stabilizing a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration stability and function <EOS>
<SOS> reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted <EOS>
<SOS> both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation <EOS>
<SOS> in benign goiter thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland <EOS>
<SOS> there is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with graves disease <EOS>
<SOS> in germany thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> however there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret proto oncogene mutations thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation <EOS>
<SOS> the cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with medullary carcinomas persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure <EOS>
<SOS> thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> the operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland <EOS>
<SOS> tyrosinemia type i is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products succinylacetoacetone mainly <EOS>
<SOS> typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement <EOS>
<SOS> there are three main forms of the disease the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age <EOS>
<SOS> experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults <EOS>
<SOS> the present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings <EOS>
<SOS> ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding sdb are only seldom mentioned in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> however if no sdb is present no one will look for these structures <EOS>
<SOS> in our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium <EOS>
<SOS> 6 car passengers age between <NUM> and <NUM> years which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year <EOS>
<SOS> 2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> case the base of the skull was broken and in <NUM> cases no skull fracture was present no serious focal brain injury had occured in these <NUM> cases but <NUM> victims had signs of diffuse brain injury <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> in one case survival for <NUM> days a minor sdb 20 ml was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis another victim died at the scene <EOS>
<SOS> the other <NUM> victims survived between <NUM> and <NUM> hours without developing sdb and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> this combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and sdb is restrictred <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature <EOS>
<SOS> a rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the sdb in the presented cases <EOS>
<SOS> implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear provided they are fully implantable <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly a comprehensive interdisciplinary combined project was initiated at the ent clinic of the university of tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids <EOS>
<SOS> a novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described <EOS>
<SOS> unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle shaped heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane <EOS>
<SOS> the transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid <EOS>
<SOS> transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements <EOS>
<SOS> the transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range greater than <NUM> khz <EOS>
<SOS> below this resonance and down to low frequencies the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around <NUM> nm <EOS>
<SOS> at low and middle frequencies of up to <NUM> khz these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound pressure levels of around <NUM> db spl <EOS>
<SOS> at higher frequencies of up to <NUM> khz the output level increases to about <NUM> db spl <EOS>
<SOS> nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels less than 0 1 throughout the whole transfer range <EOS>
<SOS> electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems <EOS>
<SOS> particularly this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss <EOS>
<SOS> in craniomaxillofacial traumatology surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction a surgeon is aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway <EOS>
<SOS> precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders <EOS>
<SOS> in order to develop these strategies knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma primary radiological investigations and further diagnostic measures are important <EOS>
<SOS> due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions we established flash evoked visual potentials vep and the electroretinogram erg as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact even if pathological but still present or absent <EOS>
<SOS> case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss <EOS>
<SOS> the electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography ct are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma <EOS>
<SOS> the results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage <EOS>
<SOS> the conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone megadosis regimen 30 mg urbason kg bodyweight i v <EOS>
<SOS> and <NUM> mg kg bodyweight h i v <EOS>
<SOS> for the following <NUM> h <EOS>
<SOS> surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by ct <EOS>
<SOS> prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated <EOS>
<SOS> to fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required <EOS>
<SOS> in the presence of preterm labor premature rupture of the membranes and preterm maturation of the cervix there is an increased risk for premature birth <EOS>
<SOS> there is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor maturation of the cervix and preterm rupture of the membranes <EOS>
<SOS> apart from classical hormones various pro inflammatory cytokines act as mediators <EOS>
<SOS> at the fetal maternal interface which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua myometrium and the cervix on the maternal side an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed <EOS>
<SOS> melatonin n acetyl 5 methoxytryptamine is a hormone with multiple functions in humans produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by adrenergic receptors <EOS>
<SOS> serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between <NUM> and <NUM> a m melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm daily sleep induction aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra and intracellular free radical scavenger <EOS>
<SOS> melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals the most damaging of all free radicals <EOS>
<SOS> melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e g <EOS>
<SOS> atopic eczema psoriasis and malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect <EOS>
<SOS> topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of uv erythema <EOS>
<SOS> penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin <EOS>
<SOS> lung dust analyses were performed on tumor free lung tissue from surgical samples of <NUM> carcinoid tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients occupation as stone mason <EOS>
<SOS> no evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of <NUM> repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the department of surgery at the herz jesu krankenhaus fulda from <NUM> to 1995 showed that meniscal lesions were the most common n 89 60 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of meniscal lesions n 45 50 6 occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected <EOS>
<SOS> the most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions <EOS>
<SOS> conversely contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in <NUM> cases 20 2 while de novo lesions occurred in <NUM> cases 29 2 <EOS>
<SOS> a coincidence of meniscal injury with first or second grade cartilage damage was documented <NUM> in <NUM> patients 39 3 whereas <NUM> patients 60 7 had normal intra articular cartilage <EOS>
<SOS> cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage shaving <EOS>
<SOS> concerning patients postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by oak score the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function 65 2 and showed good or excellent outcome in the oak score 88 8 <EOS>
<SOS> patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area p 0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively <EOS>
<SOS> however patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit <EOS>
<SOS> the present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease specific stress of eighty six patients with psoriasis and fifty eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the psorisol clinic hersbruck germany <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease the patients were offered practice in relaxation techniques social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical change was assessed by pasi and scorad respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases mhf and a questionnaire for health related control attributes gkü s served as psychometric measures <EOS>
<SOS> patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre post comparison <EOS>
<SOS> social fears avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes <EOS>
<SOS> dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60 70 of patients <EOS>
<SOS> surprisingly these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries including germany <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of hannover which has about <NUM> million inhabitants <EOS>
<SOS> in germany special prescription forms i e triplicate forms have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids <EOS>
<SOS> at the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> for two observation periods of <NUM> months lasting from january to june <NUM> and from january to june <NUM> all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the aok hannover one of the major medical insurance companies were evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> the reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these <NUM> months was determined excluding e g days of hospitalization <EOS>
<SOS> during the two observation periods only <NUM> 1988 and <NUM> 1991 of the practitioners in the region of hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine <EOS>
<SOS> although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients only <MOB> of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients <EOS>
<SOS> in two thirds of the patients cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug <EOS>
<SOS> the total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was <NUM> in <NUM> and <NUM> in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> altogether <NUM> prescription forms in <NUM> and <NUM> prescription forms in <NUM> had been issued for these patients <EOS>
<SOS> applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient only <NUM> of the patients in <NUM> and <NUM> in <NUM> received a regular prescription of strong opioids every <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the mean time interval between separate prescriptions was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days in <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally <EOS>
<SOS> our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer only <NUM> 1988 and <NUM> 1991 of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics <EOS>
<SOS> comparing the results from the observation period in <NUM> with the results from <NUM> it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed <EOS>
<SOS> there are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue <EOS>
<SOS> the legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the regulations were simplified nevertheless this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners <EOS>
<SOS> thus further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs <EOS>
<SOS> the long term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of merle d aubigné and postel pain mobility walking <EOS>

<SOS> a <NUM> year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma present on the left side of her nose for two months <EOS>
<SOS> after repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal <EOS>
<SOS> this led to complete resolution within <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations <EOS>
<SOS> between january <NUM> and june 1996 <NUM> inpatients at our hospital mean age <NUM> years were treated with electroconvulsive therapy ect <EOS>

<SOS> the tragedy which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact <EOS>
<SOS> the conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of hypocrates <EOS>
<SOS> subjective and objective opinions were mixed together <EOS>
<SOS> some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted <EOS>
<SOS> there is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable but in contrast to other countries in germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade fb the emergency medical service system ems and the general practitioners emergency service gps <EOS>
<SOS> due to this fact valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of mainz with respect to total number fraction of emergency calls and specificity <EOS>
<SOS> further the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number 112 was calculated <EOS>
<SOS> during a 4 month period all telephone calls were registered and related to day time and origin of the call city or county and classified as non urgent or emergency calls calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed emergency calls to be transferred or unspecific calls <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> <NUM> calls were received city area 84 3 county area 15 7 most of them directed to the fb of mainz 33 086 <EOS>
<SOS> the ems dispatching center received <NUM> <NUM> calls the five gps centers <NUM> <NUM> calls <NUM> emergency calls that were directed to the police or fb needed transfer to the ems <EOS>
<SOS> during weekdays the ems and fb received the most calls with a reduced frequency on saturdays and sundays table 2 <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the highest total numbers of calls were received on saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the gps <EOS>
<SOS> the fb had the highest specificity of calls more than 50 of the calls to the gps were unspecific fig <EOS>
<SOS> of all calls 4 37 were classified as emergency calls two thirds of these came from the area of mainz during the daytime <EOS>
<SOS> during off duty hours of the gps in the city 51 of the emergency calls reached the ems directly 49 had to be connected by the police or fb <EOS>
<SOS> during duty hours of the gps the fraction of calls directed to the ems decreased significantly to 35 <EOS>
<SOS> during duty hours of the gps centers in the county area only 14 of the urgent emergency calls reached the ems dispatcher directly fig <EOS>
<SOS> compared to the multiple center mode a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the gps numbers would be answered <NUM> h a day but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days only on sundays would a decrease be expected <EOS>
<SOS> the ems area of mainz with a total of <NUM> different telephone numbers for <NUM> dispatching centers can be regarded as typical of the german situation <EOS>
<SOS> the high number of emergency calls to be transferred up to 86 under special circumstances demonstrated that this weak point in the german ems system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number <EOS>
<SOS> this should occur when a europe wide three digit number 112 will be instituted probably in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the continued existence of 5 or 10 digit telephone numbers for non urgent calls may be useful for allowing non verbal differentiation of calls <EOS>
<SOS> in any case all telephone numbers including the latter calls have to enter one dispatching center <EOS>
<SOS> the main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other <EOS>

<SOS> epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to <NUM> of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc is the entity most frequently identified <EOS>
<SOS> it was described first by a warthin in <NUM> in family g and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 61 year old woman with five different cancers <EOS>
<SOS> although the strict amsterdam criteria were not fulfilled molecular analysis revealed hnpcc further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36 year old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother <EOS>
<SOS> genetic testing in clinically suspected hnpcc cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the amsterdam criteria <EOS>

<SOS> the median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> glassman 3 presented a conservative surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically <EOS>
<SOS> an orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla <EOS>
<SOS> in the period from <NUM> to 1997 <NUM> patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by glassman 3 <EOS>
<SOS> sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> after successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase a mono or bimaxillary operation was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the use of this method led to the desired result in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and x ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla <EOS>
<SOS> in one patient who was operated on at the age of <NUM> years a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture <EOS>
<SOS> the method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of le fort i plane is suitable for patients up to the age of <NUM> <EOS>

<SOS> pathogenesis arteriosclerosis and mönckeberg is disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall <EOS>
<SOS> while mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type <NUM> diabetic patients arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> möncheberg is mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media whereas arteriosclerosis associated calcifications primarily involve the intima <EOS>
<SOS> the new technique of non invasive magnetic resonance mr sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland <EOS>
<SOS> ten volunteers and <NUM> patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study <EOS>
<SOS> diseases included pleomorphic adenoma cystadenolymphoma carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma ductal carcinoma adenoid cystic carcinoma lymphoepithelial carcinoma non hodgkin is lymphoma sialolithiasis sialadenitis heerfordt is syndrome and congenital duct ectasies <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the usually performed t1 and t2 cross sectional sequences a heavily weighted t2 sequence tr 3600 te 800 was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid filled parotid duct <EOS>
<SOS> results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients except one with sicca syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> pathological conditions such as duct dilatations duct strictures obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable <EOS>
<SOS> while x ray sialography obtained a higher resolution only mr sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction as well as all ductal cysts <EOS>
<SOS> our findings show that mr sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system <EOS>
<SOS> there have been no contraindications or complications to date because mr sialography is non invasive <EOS>
<SOS> the technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve <EOS>
<SOS> substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields <EOS>
<SOS> such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators mlc <EOS>
<SOS> for treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the <NUM> d intensity matrices for each photon field <EOS>
<SOS> at the german cancer research center deutsches krebsforschungszentrum such a program has been developed under the name of konrad conformal radiotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> although it is an independent application it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present <EOS>
<SOS> so called inverse planning differs from conventional <NUM> d planning as the trial and error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided <EOS>
<SOS> instead the radio oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the so called dvh optimization allows aimed partial overdosage especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results <EOS>

<SOS> a child with typical signs of the cat eye syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported <EOS>
<SOS> in a chromosome analysis 47 xx mar de novo an extrachromosome was detected <EOS>
<SOS> using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> however there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations <EOS>
<SOS> the great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> according to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome <EOS>
<SOS> probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome <EOS>

<SOS> objective elevated levels of interleukin 1 il 1 and interleukin 6 il 6 have been reported after cardiac operation during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection <EOS>
<SOS> although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect the actual mechanism is not completely understood <EOS>
<SOS> speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus <EOS>
<SOS> therefore this study analyzes whether il 1 and or il 6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus <EOS>
<SOS> methods during aorto coronary bypass operation human muscle fibers were excised n 32 and skinned using triton x 100 <EOS>
<SOS> the experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself <EOS>
<SOS> different concentrations of il 1 and il 6 were applied pil 1 il 6 1 2x<MOB>m <EOS>
<SOS> force generation calcium sensitivity and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured <EOS>
<SOS> experiments were carried out at optimal length bath temperature <NUM> °c and isometric conditions <EOS>
<SOS> results none of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to il 1 and il 6 <EOS>
<SOS> despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of il 1 and il 6 pil 1 il 6 10 5m no significant effect occurred <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore no difference in calcium sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of il 1 and il 6 could be observed <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions thus there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by il 1 or il 6 <EOS>
<SOS> given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> these data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising <EOS>
<SOS> indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis kiehnböck is disease rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint <EOS>
<SOS> the resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion we recommend resection arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo metacarpal osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load <EOS>
<SOS> therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients <EOS>
<SOS> of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure <EOS>
<SOS> it can be indicated for stt osteoarthritis kiehnböck is disease scapho lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint <EOS>
<SOS> persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation <EOS>
<SOS> in advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient <EOS>
<SOS> increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist is workplace providing more than <NUM> different parameters of the patient is condition have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form <EOS>
<SOS> consequently this most common method of record keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years computerised data acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records <EOS>
<SOS> but after a 7 year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record keeping will achieve wider acceptance <EOS>
<SOS> the first is the handling problem which was discussed in a previous paper 11 <EOS>
<SOS> the second major problem is the appearance of artifacts caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper <NUM> courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process the efficiency of that artifact filter was validated in <NUM> of the <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> based on more than 30 00 values for each parameter the incidence of artifacts was 3 7 <EOS>
<SOS> however only 0 1 0 5 of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter <EOS>
<SOS> the method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters figs <EOS>
<SOS> 1b and 2b and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data examination processes which are currently being developed in our clinic <EOS>

<SOS> in developed countries medical conditions rather than lack of food are the main contributors to malnutrition <EOS>
<SOS> undernutrition is especially common in older persons occuring in 5 12 of community dwelling older persons in 30 61 of hospitalized older persons and in 40 85 of persons in long term care institutions <EOS>
<SOS> the multi factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes <EOS>
<SOS> heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition <EOS>
<SOS> this structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition <EOS>
<SOS> the number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> therefore a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low dose midazolam 3 75 mg especially during the postoperative period <EOS>
<SOS> heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction <EOS>
<SOS> according to the new york heart association the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades nyha i iv <EOS>

<SOS> psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in <NUM> consecutive patients of a medical geriatric department in a general hospital <EOS>
<SOS> based on the clinical examination and the values of the mini mental state examination 2 <NUM> patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state <EOS>
<SOS> the other <NUM> patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening scales geriatric depression scale 11 hospital anxiety and depression scale 4 <EOS>
<SOS> if these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff <EOS>
<SOS> dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests <EOS>
<SOS> psychic disorders were found in <NUM> patients mostly adaptation disorders and depressions the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the screening instruments turned out to be reliable so they can be recommended for further use <EOS>
<SOS> difficult to answer remains the question how the treatment of the psychic disorders in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient can be implemented in a medical geriatric department <EOS>
<SOS> based on the trauma registry of the german society of trauma surgery an interclinical quality management qm system was implemented <EOS>

<SOS> for invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media cm with excellent tolerability are available <EOS>
<SOS> the governing practical factors for cm are x ray opacity and biocompatibility <EOS>
<SOS> tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity osmolality and ionic concentration <EOS>
<SOS> in germany the nonionic cm are currently preferred <EOS>
<SOS> because of its low thrombotic complications the ionic cm ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with known cm incompatibility the prophylactic application of h1 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications <EOS>
<SOS> in impaired renal function hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken <EOS>
<SOS> background in the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and pc iol implantation <EOS>
<SOS> a judgement on the patient is quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease <EOS>
<SOS> very often there is no correlation between these parameters <EOS>
<SOS> it is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question naire since non life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequently used questionnaires are the sf 36 and the nottingham health profile <EOS>
<SOS> however these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately <EOS>
<SOS> therefore specific tools such as the dlqi dermatology life quality index and skindex have been established for dermatology <EOS>

<SOS> the value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome mds <EOS>
<SOS> clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38 69 cases 55 <EOS>
<SOS> the chromosome aberrations especially complex changes were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the mds patients <EOS>
<SOS> our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of <NUM> year clostridium difficile associated diarrhea which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic <EOS>
<SOS> the disease is associated with antibiotic therapy due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with clostridium difficile <EOS>
<SOS> symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea abdominal pain fever and acute phase response <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when in addition to typical clinical symptoms a toxin positive stool specimen was found <EOS>
<SOS> oral vancomycin was effective in all cases leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters <EOS>
<SOS> according to recent results in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin resistance and in view of higher treatment costs metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients <EOS>

<SOS> current understanding of this association is reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> an analysis of relevant studies published between <NUM> and <NUM> shows that a relatively high percentage of tmd patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise <EOS>
<SOS> however a cause effect relationship has not been established to date <EOS>
<SOS> theories that try to explain the concurrence of tmd symptoms and ear symptoms particularly tinnitus by a common underlying cause remain speculative <EOS>
<SOS> it has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence tmds and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone <EOS>
<SOS> a methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered <EOS>
<SOS> owing to the lack of prospective controlled and randomized studies statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in tmd patients are not well supported <EOS>

<SOS> due to advances in surgical methods such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis there is a trend towards surgical therapy at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa <EOS>
<SOS> this trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible <EOS>
<SOS> along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized <EOS>
<SOS> this consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling even more so in children <EOS>

<SOS> results the prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15 8 <EOS>
<SOS> additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4 of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant differences in age or sex distribution history of tobacco habits or diet <NUM> between patients with or without leukoplakia <EOS>
<SOS> t1 carcinomas were found in 62 5 of patients with and 24 4 of patients without associated leukoplakia whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre operative staging of the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with oscc was low compared to retrospective studies <EOS>
<SOS> the presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor except of tumor size <EOS>
<SOS> the results emphasize that most oscc develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients <EOS>

<SOS> currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require <EOS>
<SOS> the need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ preserving surgery for example as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp <EOS>

<SOS> numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending <EOS>
<SOS> current classifications are based on clinical histopathological or prognostic parameters as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade brocq <EOS>
<SOS> in order to develop more satisfying classifications recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> the most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations <EOS>
<SOS> research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents <EOS>

<SOS> it is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively <EOS>
<SOS> this study presents a risk calculation challenging this view <EOS>
<SOS> three strategies are presented prophylactic indication on principle a elective operation in every second case b and operation in case of strangulation only c <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that for the male german population aged <NUM> years and over <NUM> <NUM> a <NUM> <NUM> b and <NUM> c inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually <NUM> a <NUM> b and <NUM> c perioperative deaths would occur connected with <NUM> a <NUM> b and <NUM> c years of life lost respectively <EOS>
<SOS> thus operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a small reduction of life expectancy <EOS>
<SOS> these data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering <EOS>
<SOS> there is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation <EOS>
<SOS> since first described by kibler 1955 hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment <EOS>

<SOS> aim of the study and methods in the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study eps was performed <EOS>
<SOS> before eps t1 at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation vt vf the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore before investigation after induction of a vt vf and after a <NUM> minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ecg was performed <EOS>
<SOS> nine patients showed a so called lactate reversal i e an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development during inducibility of a vt vf group a <EOS>
<SOS> the control group consisted of <NUM> patients without ischemia related vt vf group b <EOS>
<SOS> results in group a significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 qrs <MOB> <NUM> vs <MOB> 16 74 p 0 08 rms <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> 10 72 p 0 01 las <NUM> <NUM> vs <NUM> 10 72 p 0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> in group b no significant changes could be measured <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the prevalence of late potentials increased in group a from 66 t1 to 89 t2 whereas in group b no increase was detectable <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions these data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple organ failure <EOS>
<SOS> important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ards are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations fio2 which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> as no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and fio2 <EOS>
<SOS> therefore pressure and volume limited ventilation modes with positive end expiratory pressure controlled hypercapnia differential lung ventilation when appropriate positioning particularly prone and aggressive dehydration are used <EOS>
<SOS> should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange the patients may be additionally treated by veno venous extracorporeal gas exchange <EOS>
<SOS> to reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation should be used <EOS>
<SOS> from april <NUM> to august 1993 <NUM> patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ards <NUM> were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange survival rate 88 and <NUM> additionally underwent artificial gas exchange survival rate 57 <EOS>
<SOS> the overall survival rate was 75 <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of these experiences we conclude that this step by step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ards <EOS>

<SOS> past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome fs revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli hyperalgesia and a general perceptual amplification of sensations hypervigilance <EOS>
<SOS> in order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in fs cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in <NUM> fs patients <EOS>
<SOS> results were compared with those from age matched painfree controls <EOS>
<SOS> amplitudes of middle latency n1 and long latency p2 laser evoked potentials leps were significantly higher in fs than in controls <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in fs than in controls <EOS>
<SOS> however auditory evoked potentials aeps did not differ between groups <EOS>
<SOS> enhanced n1 and p2 amplitudes of leps suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in fs respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among fs and control patients <EOS>
<SOS> yet the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation not applied in this study to reveal abnormal non nociceptive perceptual amplification in fs is discussed <EOS>

<SOS> seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery n 2 or sclerosis with <NUM> ml of 96 ethanol n 5 <EOS>
<SOS> six patients had instant and constant relief 3 years observation of their pain <EOS>
<SOS> in two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful <EOS>
<SOS> only two patients needed open resection <EOS>
<SOS> compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk transcutaneous ct guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method especially in the region of the femoral neck <EOS>
<SOS> we live in an epoch that could be designated as the post gutenberg era <EOS>
<SOS> writing is no longer the dominant sign system <EOS>
<SOS> it is replaced by electronic signs <EOS>
<SOS> we consider approximately the year <NUM> as the turning point between these two epochs because by then in the years after the 2nd world war the american households were saturated with televisions <EOS>
<SOS> thereby the new sign system asserted itself <EOS>
<SOS> the topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects which i prefer to call virtual objects <EOS>
<SOS> the manipulation of object choice and object relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well <EOS>
<SOS> these electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own <EOS>
<SOS> a totally new class of objects came into being the class of virtual objects <EOS>
<SOS> these are electronically transformed completed or wholly electronically produced objects <EOS>
<SOS> this procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object choice and object relationships <EOS>
<SOS> the manipulated object choice and object relationship is born and moreover a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones <EOS>
<SOS> a change of the socio cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process <EOS>
<SOS> new patterns of socio cultural understanding develop that could be described as industrial feudalism <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships and to interprete them according to our present possibilities <EOS>
<SOS> in this article <NUM> randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> all studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid <EOS>
<SOS> because of differing study designs a meta analysis of the data is not possible <EOS>
<SOS> dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case <EOS>
<SOS> the positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13 <EOS>
<SOS> using dna image cytometry on restained conventional pap smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells <EOS>
<SOS> the identification of dna aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90 <EOS>
<SOS> dna aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade h sil which have to be treated whereas lack of dna aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions l sil which have only to be controlled <EOS>
<SOS> the methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation <EOS>
<SOS> in this brief article i attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy the key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist is empathic listening coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills <EOS>
<SOS> on the debit side patients hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome <EOS>
<SOS> percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue and without exposure of the trachea <EOS>
<SOS> the early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare <EOS>
<SOS> although it is a simple procedure it is not a minor operation <EOS>
<SOS> users must be familiar with the technique the indications and contra indications for the procedure as well as the complications <EOS>
<SOS> proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications <EOS>
<SOS> percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen <EOS>
<SOS> it can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications <EOS>
<SOS> a short history the indications and contraindications the early and late complications of the technique and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> in this study a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate placed implants was performed <EOS>
<SOS> an implantation of <NUM> self cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in <NUM> beagle dogs <EOS>
<SOS> of these implants <NUM> were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and <NUM> implants were placed after <NUM> months of healing after extraction <EOS>
<SOS> for dynamic histomorphometry fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia <EOS>
<SOS> the specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically <NUM> months after implantation <EOS>
<SOS> a histologic dynamic and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs <EOS>
<SOS> a mean surface of osseointegration of 75 7 and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24 2 was seen in immediate placed implants <EOS>
<SOS> for delayed implantation an osseointegrated surface of 80 7 and a soft tissue covering of 19 3 was examined <EOS>
<SOS> the fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements hemidesmosomes around delayed implants <EOS>
<SOS> the result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups p 0 1 <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion it can be stated that a new steady state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen <NUM> months after implant insertion in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> there was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part <EOS>
<SOS> the lower level of osseointegration in immediate placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part <EOS>
<SOS> thus a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted <EOS>
<SOS> polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial halluxside postaxial or ulnar side of the little toe and central middle toes <EOS>
<SOS> the duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit <EOS>
<SOS> the metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal <EOS>
<SOS> surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems for esthetic reasons or especially in duplication of the metatarsales because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative analysis including x ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results <EOS>
<SOS> across centers transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations <EOS>
<SOS> excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in <NUM> of patients <EOS>
<SOS> various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery <EOS>
<SOS> blood conservation methods were reviewed critically <EOS>
<SOS> avoidance of preoperative anemia tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations the use of autologous blood and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions <EOS>
<SOS> perioperatively maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis <EOS>
<SOS> injections with botulinum toxin type a btx are considered the first line treatment for spasmodic torticollis st blepharospasm bl and hemifacial spasm hfs <EOS>
<SOS> because btx brings only temporary and partial relief patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with st bl and hfs was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> two hundred questionnaires were considered 112 ts <NUM> bl <NUM> hfs <EOS>
<SOS> btx was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups median 2 good effect <EOS>
<SOS> despite citalopram and physiotherapy median 3 average effect all other therapies were rated with a median of 4 minimal effect <EOS>
<SOS> patients with st tried 7 7 patients with bl <NUM> and patients with hfs <NUM> different types of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion btx is the most effective treatment for patients with st bl and hfs as rated subjectively <EOS>
<SOS> further evaluation of therapies additional to btx injections is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> the perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient is preoperative state of health <EOS>
<SOS> anesthesia per se however may also result in severe perioperative patho physiological changes which may be both desired e g <EOS>
<SOS> analgesia vasodilation in vascular surgery or detrimental e g <EOS>
<SOS> hypothermia ventilatory depression and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used e g <EOS>
<SOS> general anesthesia vs regional anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> yet all anesthestic techniques have in common that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention but may expand far into the postoperative period <EOS>
<SOS> therefore many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> this finding may be due to at least three factors <EOS>
<SOS> 1 many side effects related to anesthesia due to close postoperative monitoring are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase e g <EOS>
<SOS> in the recovery room thereby preventing serious complications <EOS>
<SOS> 2 postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques <EOS>
<SOS> 3 besides the factor anesthesia may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality e g <EOS>
<SOS> the factor anesthetist which are hardly quantified <EOS>
<SOS> the fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not however result in anesthetic nihilism <EOS>
<SOS> rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient e g <EOS>
<SOS> lack of a recovery room to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> whether the use of a certain technique e g <EOS>
<SOS> spinal or epidural anesthesia may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications e g <EOS>
<SOS> rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery is presently under investigation <EOS>
<SOS> this paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose <EOS>
<SOS> we then introduce its objectives the members of the study group the composition of the collective and selection of cases and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data <EOS>
<SOS> results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward <EOS>
<SOS> after some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby <NUM> g a developmental risk model is presented <EOS>
<SOS> this is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention <EOS>
<SOS> in the ulm study the comprehensive parent centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy supportive group psychotherapy a home visit and a video based sensitivity training <EOS>
<SOS> the intervention aims to improve parental coping the process of attachment and parent infant interaction <EOS>
<SOS> the theoretical implications the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 55 year old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma <EOS>
<SOS> he developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died <NUM> days after the operation due to untreatable diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia <EOS>
<SOS> rudolf nissen was born in neisse schlesien <NUM> september <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to <NUM> he was the favorite pupil of ferdinand sauerbruch in munich and berlin <EOS>
<SOS> 1930 he became professor of surgery at the charité <EOS>
<SOS> the assumption of power by the nazi regime forced nissen to resign his position and end his career in germany <EOS>
<SOS> he took over the surgical chair in istanbul turkey <EOS>
<SOS> emigrating in <NUM> to the usa he held surgical positions in hospitals at new york and accepted in <NUM> the chair of surgery at the university of basel switzerland <EOS>
<SOS> nissen died in riehen basel on <NUM> january <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> nissen was a critical observant clinician an efficient and popular physician a teacher and a speaker <EOS>
<SOS> of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery the first successful pneumectomy in man the classical works about the treatment of gastro oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia <EOS>
<SOS> the nissen rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in europe and the usa <EOS>
<SOS> this study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely <EOS>
<SOS> the particular procedure is discussed and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1997 the author supervised <NUM> outpatient operations of which <NUM> were arthroscopic <EOS>
<SOS> the observed complications are listed and evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> overall outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients <EOS>
<SOS> the criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out <EOS>
<SOS> the schering atlas is a teaching file in ct and mri anatomy designed for physicians and students <EOS>
<SOS> it is available on cd rom shows good image quality and is easy to use in medium price range personal computer systems <EOS>
<SOS> because of the amount and quality of image material the schering atlas is price is appropriate for institutions but not for private users <EOS>
<SOS> m linehan developed dialectical behavioral therapy specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients <EOS>
<SOS> it rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress <EOS>
<SOS> the numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self destructive behavior inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem solving <EOS>
<SOS> this concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them <EOS>
<SOS> a comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies <EOS>
<SOS> parallel to development of the therapy itself a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual is guidelines thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> an initial controlled randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels <EOS>
<SOS> in the current endeavor to develop disorder specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders dialectical behavioral therapy is a noteworthy model <EOS>
<SOS> complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent however osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin track infection of the halo device in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding <EOS>
<SOS> the possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases as well as indications for the halo clinical symptoms of pin track infections necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system analogical to electronic data processing systems as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system <EOS>
<SOS> thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul <EOS>
<SOS> especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function <EOS>
<SOS> with this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained <EOS>
<SOS> empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in germany are rare <EOS>
<SOS> there is a lack of cross sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long term course of mental health care costs <EOS>
<SOS> this study combines data from two cost studies on patients with schizophrenia conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of <NUM> years to draw conclusions about the long term course of these costs <EOS>
<SOS> the direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77 0 during <NUM> years while the costs of a permanents stay in a long term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78 5 in the same period <EOS>
<SOS> this increase was <NUM> and <NUM> per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in germany during the interval between the two studies <EOS>
<SOS> this higher than average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost effectiveness <EOS>
<SOS> thus this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in germany which was demanded by an expert commission of the government in the mid seventies <EOS>
<SOS> background the usefulness of holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited <EOS>
<SOS> in adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes <EOS>
<SOS> there have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children <EOS>
<SOS> the immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in <NUM> patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity pharynx and larynx <EOS>
<SOS> an operation time longer than <NUM> h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes cd4 t lymphocytes and cd8 t lymphocytes <EOS>
<SOS> the cd4 cd8 ratio as a marker for the down regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range <EOS>
<SOS> cd4 lymphocyte counts increased <NUM> days after operation while cd8 lymphocytes were found elevated <NUM> weeks after sugery <EOS>
<SOS> the in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for <NUM> to <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> interleukins interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> decreases of lymphocytes especially cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> extensive trauma age different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses <EOS>
<SOS> both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment <EOS>
<SOS> monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline na and or serotonin 5 ht their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord <EOS>
<SOS> antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics <EOS>
<SOS> the present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment <EOS>
<SOS> from a preclinical experimental point of view it can be expected that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective na or 5 ht uptake inhibitors <EOS>
<SOS> the analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs given alone or in combination with other analgetics in chronic pain syndromes <EOS>
<SOS> 57 clinical trials were separated into <NUM> groups according to their scientific quality 1 placebo controlled double blind studies with high power 2 placebo controlled double blind studies with low power 3 4 open controlled studies or studies with historical controls 5 case reports <EOS>
<SOS> a study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence <EOS>
<SOS> the most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order amitriptyline clomipramine desipramine imipramine doxepin <EOS>
<SOS> a statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment however must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations <EOS>
<SOS> intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis <EOS>
<SOS> in critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> therefore surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further <EOS>
<SOS> the cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step <EOS>
<SOS> in this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested <EOS>
<SOS> studies in infants with chronic lung disease cld showed that i if sao2 was kept <NUM> via generous prescription of home oxygen rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed ii weight gain was significantly better with o2 therapy than without it ii increasing sao2 from <NUM> to <NUM> by providing low flow oxygen resulted in a <NUM> reduction of pulmonary artery pressure iv hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance and v low flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in sao2 to <NUM> even in infants who had values of <NUM> at rest <EOS>
<SOS> these data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in cld infants if baseline sao2 is <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> for older infants particularly with cf only few data are available <EOS>
<SOS> in these patients oxygen may only be given if sao2 is <NUM> unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia e g pulmonary hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice <EOS>
<SOS> side effects include the risk of co2 retention which occurs occasionally in children with cf or sleep related upper airway obstruction but has not been reported for infants with cld <EOS>
<SOS> to identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required performance of a sleep recording of sao2 and co2 with and without oxygen is suggested <EOS>
<SOS> in infants with cld home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social economic relevance <EOS>
<SOS> for treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards <EOS>
<SOS> the demand for stable osteosynthesis of a3 b2 b3 and c1 c2 fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting even for the elder patient <EOS>
<SOS> the isolated external fixation with k wires represent special situation <EOS>
<SOS> supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development <EOS>
<SOS> introduction pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus <EOS>
<SOS> due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> case a 34 year old primiapara with hypertension up to 240 120 mmhg <EOS>
<SOS> after diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion the definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24 h urine collection <EOS>
<SOS> localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and mri <EOS>
<SOS> the definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers <EOS>
<SOS> if discovered later in pregnancy delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> since about <NUM> of pheochromocytomas are malignant postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by mibg scintigraphy chemotherapy or surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> ionizing radiation from natural or man made sources may affect human health <EOS>
<SOS> the main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer <EOS>
<SOS> to quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed <EOS>
<SOS> the ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation <EOS>
<SOS> homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated <EOS>
<SOS> in an asymptomatic 13 year old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the aa <EOS>
<SOS> iliacae a combination which so far has not been described that has not been reported before <EOS>
<SOS> the vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic <EOS>
<SOS> angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the aa <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months of low density lipoprotein ldl apheresis angiographically there was no pregression but even slight improvement of vascular the disease <EOS>
<SOS> discussion since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia <EOS>
<SOS> ldl apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> since <NUM> almost <NUM> patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic effect on <NUM> adult patients was evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> after a mean of <NUM> treatments the colour lightened by between 33 and 100 in 70 of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains <EOS>
<SOS> in this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5 <EOS>
<SOS> the results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions <EOS>
<SOS> the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains <EOS>
<SOS> most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the scope of the sutures affected the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects <EOS>
<SOS> the etiopathology is still unclear <EOS>
<SOS> various therapies have been developed over the past <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> however tessier is technique of fronto orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations <EOS>
<SOS> numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique <EOS>
<SOS> it is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology <EOS>
<SOS> injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> this is different for injuries of the extensor tendon <EOS>
<SOS> three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones 1 th i 3 th ii <EOS>
<SOS> the shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias <EOS>
<SOS> the operation is an important part of a surgeon is repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time especially when faced with strangulation when tension free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail <EOS>
<SOS> when properly done the shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate <EOS>
<SOS> other particular advantages of the technique are safety the use of local anaesthesia benign postoperative complications and the cost which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques <EOS>
<SOS> acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge <EOS>
<SOS> acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis clinical awareness angiography and therapy exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction embolectomy thrombectomy and or bowel resection <EOS>
<SOS> the difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from <NUM> to <NUM> in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from <NUM> to <NUM> in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins <EOS>
<SOS> improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures intra arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection <EOS>
<SOS> for assessment of bowel viability the clinical judgement during first or second look exploration is still the most reliable parameter <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom free patients <EOS>
<SOS> prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances <EOS>
<SOS> thirty nine of <NUM> patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis caa the remaining <NUM> patients additionally had a colon j pouch cpa constructed <EOS>
<SOS> after pouch anal anastomosis local septic complications occurred in <NUM> of patients compared to <NUM> after coloanal anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> stool frequency after pouch anal anastomosis was <NUM> per <NUM> h compared to <NUM> per <NUM> h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure p 0 053 <EOS>
<SOS> continence was slightly better in the pouch group n s and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis p 0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> this study supports the construction of a colon j pouch after deep rectal resection as the pouch anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of flow directed pulmonary artery pa catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology <EOS>
<SOS> there have been several developments of this equipment in recent years including continuous monitoring of mixed venous o2 saturation sv o2 and cardiac output co <EOS>
<SOS> the high purchase price however is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of sv o2 and co <EOS>
<SOS> purpose persistent hypotony with maculo pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin c when used during filtration surgery <EOS>
<SOS> we wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy <EOS>
<SOS> the detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial i or necrotizing n pancreatitis ap <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with ap may correlate with the severity of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective clinical trial from october <NUM> to august 1993 <NUM> patients with ap were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available elisa kits and c reactive protein crp by laser nephelometry <EOS>
<SOS> six of <NUM> patients with nap died either early n 1 or of late septic complications <EOS>
<SOS> the peak of cytokine and crp level in the first <NUM> days of hospitalization was used for calculation <EOS>
<SOS> the il 6 concentration in the blood reached up to <NUM> pg ml in the 1st few days depending on the severity of ap and dropped to almost zero in the next days independently of the clinical course <EOS>

<SOS> in the blood samples of five patients with i or nap no tnf was detectable <EOS>
<SOS> the blood levels of il 6 and to a lesser extent of il 8 and crp can predict the severity and early systemic complications of ap <EOS>
<SOS> the excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells macrophages lymphocytes and endothelial cells in the course of ap inducing early systemic complications <EOS>
<SOS> the surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters pores <NUM> µm of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study <EOS>
<SOS> the analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic bovine and phytotroph origin <EOS>
<SOS> the tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials <EOS>
<SOS> the gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric n2 kr system asap 2010 micromeritics <EOS>
<SOS> additionally for materials with a specific surface area <NUM> m2 g the pore size distribution was evaluated by the bjh method <EOS>
<SOS> two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area biooss <NUM> m2 g algipore new <NUM> m2 g <EOS>
<SOS> a medium surface area was found for algipore old 4 9 m2 g and interpore200 2 64 m2 g <EOS>

<SOS> an influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested <EOS>
<SOS> the literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from <NUM> to <NUM> was reviewed in four parts <EOS>
<SOS> in the present part <NUM> ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated <EOS>
<SOS> radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage i and iia b testicular seminoma <EOS>
<SOS> using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95 98 in stage i disease and 80 95 in stage iia b can be achieved <EOS>
<SOS> disease specific survival reaches <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> likewise radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia tin in a solitary testis or in case of a double sided tin yielding safe eradication of the in situ carcinoma of the testis <EOS>
<SOS> objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates <EOS>
<SOS> a forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor <EOS>
<SOS> since the person was planning an extended stay in africa we performed an extensive history clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases <EOS>
<SOS> we further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations <EOS>
<SOS> possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> a multifactorial etiology underlies the <NUM> majority of cases of alzheimer is disease ad <EOS>
<SOS> both ill defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> allele <NUM> of apoe is a genetic risk factor <EOS>
<SOS> its presence increases the risk of developing ad <EOS>
<SOS> however presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise <EOS>
<SOS> apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease there are rare variants which are inherited as mendelian traits <EOS>
<SOS> to date three genes are known that can be <NUM> mutated in these rare forms of ad <EOS>
<SOS> of these mutations in the gene presenilin <NUM> on chromosome <NUM> are most frequent <EOS>
<SOS> in addition mutations in the gene presenilin <NUM> on chromosome <NUM> and in the amyloid precursor protein gene app on chromosome 21 occur in autosomal dominant ad <EOS>
<SOS> this article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of ad and discusses its relevance for patients with ad and their relatives <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother daughter relationship with the conceptions of the lesbian complex poluda korte the symbiotic illusion halberstadt freud the higher permeability of the ego boundaries rohde dachser and the conflict of separation individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life berger <EOS>
<SOS> in the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender female female psychoanalyses a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre oedipal mother daughter relationship are revided <EOS>
<SOS> case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst is relationship towards her patient <EOS>
<SOS> there has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years <EOS>
<SOS> associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> over a five year period <NUM> patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated <EOS>
<SOS> out of these <NUM> 30 9 sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample <EOS>
<SOS> type b injuries according to the ao classification occurred in <NUM> 41 patients type c fractures in <NUM> 59 patients <EOS>
<SOS> the spleen liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs 58 9 followed by urogenital lesions 46 6 nerve injuries 25 6 and vascular lesions 15 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56 4 and severe head injuries gcs8 in 33 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the mean hannover polytraumascore was <NUM> points the mean injury severity score <NUM> points <EOS>
<SOS> osteosnthesis was performed in <NUM> pelvic ring fractures 53 eight procedures 50 in type b fractures and <NUM> 56 in type c fractures <EOS>
<SOS> in type b injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case <EOS>
<SOS> in type c injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients <EOS>
<SOS> in four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars <EOS>
<SOS> three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach <EOS>
<SOS> all surviving <NUM> patients were followed up for an average of <NUM> months range 7 59 months after the trauma <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the german society of trauma surgery <EOS>
<SOS> 53 4 of the type b fractures showed a good clinical outcome 47 6 a poor outcome <EOS>
<SOS> 15 4 with type c fractures presented with a good outcome 84 6 with a poor outcome <EOS>
<SOS> 80 of the type b and 23 of the type c fractures had a good radiological outcome <EOS>
<SOS> 20 of type b and 77 of type c injuries had a poor radiological outcome <EOS>
<SOS> five patients 12 8 sustained persistent urological symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> three of these had urinary dysfunction two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurolgical deficit after a head injury <EOS>
<SOS> ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality rate was 28 <EOS>
<SOS> seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding four in the intensive care unit from multi organ failure <EOS>
<SOS> the management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury <EOS>
<SOS> lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present <EOS>
<SOS> injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously <EOS>
<SOS> urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks we recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating <EOS>
<SOS> if this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> type c fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission <EOS>
<SOS> dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the behavior inhibition system on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other <EOS>
<SOS> the examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses <EOS>
<SOS> according to primate experiments monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate <EOS>
<SOS> young non human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful while as adults they tend to be aggressive consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake <EOS>
<SOS> these observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies <EOS>
<SOS> the implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses pcl leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular pcl implantation <EOS>
<SOS> persistent breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long term prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> using laser tyndallometry we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long term postoperative course for both surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> during the first <NUM> postoperative days flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured pcl than in the conventional pcl group <EOS>
<SOS> cell counts after transscleral suture fixation 27 7 18 3 0 075 mm3 decreased slightly during the first <NUM> postoperative days <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the conventional pcl group regained the preoperative level 2 5 5 1 after <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> after implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional pcl implantation <EOS>
<SOS> however the barrier function was re established equally in both groups in the long term <EOS>
<SOS> no signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found <EOS>
<SOS> there is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep disordered breathing <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> year old male body mass index <NUM> kg m2 was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work up in the acute hospital <EOS>
<SOS> blood pressure was adjusted with five fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation but was still elevated with non dipping as determined by long term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages <EOS>
<SOS> polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea <EOS>
<SOS> 10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal cpap blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night <EOS>
<SOS> medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge <EOS>
<SOS> moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient <EOS>
<SOS> the case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke <EOS>
<SOS> the possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> this is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the dept <EOS>
<SOS> of trauma surgery in collaboration with the medical dept <EOS>
<SOS> microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in accordance to a literature review this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> to january 1996 <NUM> patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis <EOS>
<SOS> all patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study <EOS>

<SOS> tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long term ventilated icu patients <EOS>
<SOS> in the last few years percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy pdt has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy <EOS>
<SOS> recently there is another percutaneous technique according to fantoni with translaryngeal airway access tlt available <EOS>
<SOS> our study seeks to evaluate tlt in terms of complications and practicability <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients of our surgical icu elective tlt was performed <EOS>
<SOS> mean operative time was <NUM> <NUM> range 6 27 minutes <EOS>
<SOS> severe complications such as bleeding aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted <EOS>
<SOS> a slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in <NUM> patients intraoperatively demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily <EOS>
<SOS> however no patient became hypoxic during the <URL> during the procedure gas exchange may worsen tlt should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80 <EOS>
<SOS> despite the fact that severe complications associated with tlt have recently not yet been reported physicians who perform tlt should be well trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy too <EOS>
<SOS> according to our present data tlt seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to pdt <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless for a definiteve evaluation of tlt further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary <EOS>
<SOS> there are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male <EOS>
<SOS> a study of <NUM> patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions <EOS>
<SOS> in volunteers in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of gnrh no alteration in sexual reactions occurred <EOS>
<SOS> it is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone <EOS>
<SOS> however all the known fractions correlate closely <EOS>
<SOS> the significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now <EOS>
<SOS> in an animal experiment the intracavernous pressure the density of receptors and the pdes activity depended on normal testosterone levels <EOS>
<SOS> it is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans <EOS>
<SOS> in a <NUM> years old male patient <NUM> cc of a 7 45 potassium chloride solution was inadvertently infused within <NUM> hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day <EOS>
<SOS> the epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient is legs and a level of sensory blockade to th <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed <EOS>
<SOS> for therapy a single bolus of <NUM> mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0 9 <NUM> cc h for several hours <EOS>
<SOS> about <NUM> hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> it is proposed that the use of colour coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications <EOS>
<SOS> this paper reviews respiratory muscle circulation interaction in congestive heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented <EOS>
<SOS> not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> the underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed <EOS>
<SOS> traumatic perilunate dislocations are rare lesions and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized although conventional x rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48 of cases which can be improved by performing ct or bone scan in addition to 62 and 95 repectively <EOS>
<SOS> forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment consists of open reduction predominantly of the lunate bone and internal fixation <EOS>
<SOS> huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws while smaller fragments can only be aligned with kirschner wires <EOS>
<SOS> osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator <EOS>
<SOS> the best results on the martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of damage to different tissues <EOS>
<SOS> although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20 in our series of <NUM> mixed traumatized patients in all the martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow ups <EOS>
<SOS> maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to investigate the mothers attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result <EOS>
<SOS> interleukin 2 il 2 and interferon ifn were both administered subcutaneously sc in combination with intravenously iv applied 5 fluorouracil 5 fu for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma rcc <EOS>
<SOS> the therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of <NUM> weeks which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen <EOS>
<SOS> the ifn was given in each of the <NUM> weeks 6 9 mu m2 once to three times weekly sc combined sequentially with il 2 5 20 mu m2 three times weekly sc for <NUM> weeks and 5 fu 750 mg m2 iv weekly for <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> among the <NUM> consecutive patients treated in <NUM> cases a complete and in <NUM> cases a partial remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases with an overall objective response rate of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> mean response duration was <NUM> months range 3 18 months <EOS>
<SOS> a stable state of the disease lasting 3 18 months was observed in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> the side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade i n 2 grade ii n 22 and grade ii n 6 according to the who classification <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion this triple drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive il 2 treatment regimen applied iv but without its high toxicity <EOS>
<SOS> compression therapy was employed for <NUM> weeks <NUM> patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage cvi i and cvi ii according to widmer is classification <EOS>
<SOS> compression bandaging for <NUM> weeks was followed by compression stockings for <NUM> more weeks <EOS>
<SOS> the cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy after <NUM> weeks and after finishing compression therapy after <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after <NUM> weeks along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume <EOS>
<SOS> video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter <EOS>
<SOS> compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation <EOS>
<SOS> the efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar <EOS>
<SOS> the splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock <EOS>
<SOS> the mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state <EOS>
<SOS> the specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia particularly in low flow states <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen <EOS>
<SOS> activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> so far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> as pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current <EOS>
<SOS> whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow up was studied in <NUM> patients who received the vdd single lead unipass <NUM> connected to the pacemaker unity sulzer intermedics <EOS>

<SOS> the long term follow up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally but not for the individual patient <EOS>
<SOS> endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might therefore play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin 1 et 1 release following a local endothelial injury during ptca group a and after sustained myocardial ischemia group b <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> since first described in the early 1990s coronary magnetic resonance angiography mra has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease <EOS>

<SOS> to analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments especially the disc after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with ao internal fixator we performed magnetic resonance imaging mri of the traumatised region after implant removal <EOS>
<SOS> there were two aspects of disc degeneration dd 1 biochemical changes and 2 structural damage <EOS>
<SOS> mri detects biochemical processes as one aspect of dd that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture <EOS>
<SOS> none of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability <EOS>
<SOS> we observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree <EOS>
<SOS> the supporters of upper disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage such as alteration of shape and loss of height altogether more frequent in the upper disc <EOS>
<SOS> our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to the upper disc the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone <EOS>
<SOS> besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by mri a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions <EOS>

<SOS> conclusion selective radiofrequency current ablation modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of avnrt in young patients <EOS>
<SOS> since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible we conducted a study to compare <NUM> cases from each anesthesiology department <EOS>
<SOS> all operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique <EOS>
<SOS> the two groups did not differ in age bmi operative time weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory <EOS>
<SOS> blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient is blood volume <EOS>
<SOS> blood pressure heart rate medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols <EOS>
<SOS> results means and standard deviations group i n 28 and group ii n 28 total resected tissue <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> g 1912 <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> g hb preop <EOS>

<SOS> after exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss <EOS>
<SOS> map was elevated only initially while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group ii <EOS>
<SOS> during anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane the dose of enflurane in group i could be limited to <MOB> after initial i v administration of <NUM> to <NUM> µg sufentanil while in group ii without opioids doses of 0 5 2 were required <EOS>
<SOS> the well known dose dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique even without deliberate hypotension <EOS>
<SOS> sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane <EOS>
<SOS> blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties <EOS>
<SOS> continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery <EOS>
<SOS> preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of <NUM> ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in germany <EOS>
<SOS> the effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties <EOS>
<SOS> the preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 06 and fentanyl <MOB> in <NUM> ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the university hospital mainz is described <EOS>
<SOS> to determine the physicochemical stability the concentration of bupivacaine hcl and fentanyl was assessed using hplc over a period of <NUM> days in addition the ph values were determined <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> days 95 of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> the ph baseline value had decreased from <MOB> to <MOB> units <EOS>
<SOS> the measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 06 and fentanyl <MOB> over a period of <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the infusion bag can be stored for <NUM> weeks at room temperature <EOS>
<SOS> the programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness mal needs to be determined <EOS>
<SOS> excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold esrt and the postoperatively determined mal and hearing threshold for <NUM> patients each having one of three implant types <EOS>
<SOS> the question of whether the esrt provides a practical technique to simplify improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> for the monopolar stimulation mode used for the med el and clarion implant systems the average mal and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average esrt across all electrodes <EOS>
<SOS> for the common ground stimulation mode used for the nucleus implant system a parabolic transformation was used to relate mal and esrt to one another <EOS>
<SOS> these transformations between mal values calculated from the esrt and the actual mal values determined psychoacoustically diverged considerably from one another <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it was not possible to determine the mal from the esrt with certainty <EOS>
<SOS> the esrt does however provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the mal apart from its use to control implant function <EOS>
<SOS> the determination of the exact mal will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques <EOS>
<SOS> movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems <EOS>
<SOS> we experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium yag laser vitrectomy <EOS>
<SOS> spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non arteriosclerotic aorta are rare <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 53 year old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end to end anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch <EOS>
<SOS> the iliac reconstruction was performed by ptfe interposition <EOS>
<SOS> there was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis <EOS>
<SOS> at <NUM> year follow up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in this biomechanical study the implanted unreamed humeral nail uhn has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses <EOS>
<SOS> in literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft <EOS>
<SOS> this study examined whether the implanted uhn as well as the uhn implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses the uhn has been compared biomechanically to the russell taylor humeral nail rt in paired mid shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri <EOS>
<SOS> identic paired comparison has been performed with the uhn without and uhn with interfragmentary compression <EOS>
<SOS> in anterior posterior as well as medio lateral direction stiffness under four point bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the rt <EOS>
<SOS> under torsional loading with moments of <NUM> nm <NUM> nm and <NUM> nm the uhn reached more than the double torsional stiffness <EOS>
<SOS> the rt which is only dynamically interlocked owns a high initial play between bolts and nail itself <EOS>
<SOS> through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the uhn under four point bending in anterior posterior as well as medio lateral direction augments significantly <EOS>
<SOS> also under torsional loading with moments of <NUM> nm <NUM> nm und <NUM> nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types which are critically under rotation as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures <EOS>
<SOS> while the different national health systems merge structurally cost expansion in health care is a global challenge <EOS>
<SOS> structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the usa which can be summarized as managed care <EOS>
<SOS> they are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods <EOS>
<SOS> in managed care models patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines which lead to a standardization of processes <EOS>
<SOS> financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse <EOS>
<SOS> the autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system <EOS>
<SOS> leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists <EOS>
<SOS> it is progressively shifting to financing institutions managing directors or insurance companies <EOS>
<SOS> structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the u s and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the us model is still far more expensive compared to the german system <EOS>

<SOS> on the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis <EOS>
<SOS> in the early 1980s a peptide that caused diuresis natriuresis and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups <EOS>
<SOS> this was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides followed by the characterisation of the amino acid sequences of several species <EOS>
<SOS> synthesis of the peptide cloning of the encoding gene identification and characterisation of specific receptors as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished <EOS>
<SOS> research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin atrial natriuretic peptide cdd anp and the regulation of cdd anp gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra atrial tissues <EOS>
<SOS> later on two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide bnp and c type natriuretic peptide cnp <EOS>
<SOS> these peptides share structural features with cdd anp with regard to their 17 amino acid exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond <EOS>
<SOS> another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin uro a renal borne new member of a type natriuretic peptide <EOS>
<SOS> uro was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as cdd anp containing the 17 amino acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with <NUM> additional amino acids located at the nh2 terminus of the peptide <EOS>
<SOS> regarding physiological actions data strongly support a close association between uro and urinary sodium excretion <EOS>
<SOS> the application of uro in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to cdd anp<MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> these results were encouraging for the use of uro in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure arf in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient arf in patients following liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> summarising the results of these two studies uro represents a new approach for not only prevention but also for treatment of arf following organ transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> this opens up new possibilities for the treatment of arf of other origins in intensive care medicine <EOS>

<SOS> it provides a framework for interviewing patients as well as for physical laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care <EOS>
<SOS> situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described <EOS>
<SOS> the appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician <EOS>
<SOS> further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form <EOS>
<SOS> the significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> introduction bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure <EOS>
<SOS> four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the siewert classification postoperative bile fistulas type i late strictures type ii tangential injuries of the bile duct type ii and defect lesions type iv <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature <EOS>
<SOS> methods eleven patients median age <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 17 2 with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between november <NUM> and december <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> nine patients four type ii lesions five type iv lesions were referred from another hospital <NUM> defect lesions out of <NUM> laparoscopic cholecystectomies 0 5 were documented in our own patient group <EOS>
<SOS> results four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy n 2 or hepaticojejunostomy n 2 after <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> months and were discharged from hospital after <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases with type iv lesion and a short defect an end to end anastomosis was successful hospital stay <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> however a retrocolic roux y end to side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect n 5 hospital stay <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho stomy or hepaticojejunostomy hospital stay <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center <EOS>
<SOS> in the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15 20 <EOS>
<SOS> the main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence <EOS>
<SOS> in the present autopsy series comprising <MOB> autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1 77 in jena and 1 55 in königgrätz <URL> inhabitants each <EOS>
<SOS> over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased <EOS>
<SOS> with the advent of atypical antipsychotics quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly <EOS>
<SOS> the positive effects are based not only on the compliance enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration shorter duration and overall reduction of hospital treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to <NUM> to 42 <EOS>
<SOS> in the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non perioperative myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> however in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications <EOS>
<SOS> in the last 4 6 years acute ptca has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute ptca on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless it can be assumed that acute ptca will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and if indicated acute ptca should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> in principle thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra or postoperative situation <EOS>
<SOS> however if coronary angiography and ptca are not possible thrombolysis might be taken into consideration in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis <EOS>
<SOS> since acute ptca has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction this group of patients should be especially considered <EOS>
<SOS> medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity middle ages and modern times <EOS>
<SOS> from the present state of research it is distinguished between primary illnesses in old age and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age <EOS>
<SOS> even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated <EOS>
<SOS> advances in medical sciences are a good pre condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age <EOS>
<SOS> the analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> with ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible <EOS>
<SOS> transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development such as identification of the embryo visualization of the yolk sac and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy <EOS>
<SOS> a prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma advanced maternal age early growth delay or fetal bradycardia <EOS>
<SOS> because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction surgical therapy of the small bowel ileus is difficult to standardize <EOS>
<SOS> a homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel decompression endoluminal splinting as well as abdominal closure would be desirable <EOS>
<SOS> adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure <EOS>
<SOS> small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the noble is technique replaced by the child phillips technique and its modifications <EOS>
<SOS> however as a result of the lack of controlled studies there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> this is an important task for the future especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel ileus <EOS>

<SOS> objective thirty years ago cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest <EOS>
<SOS> today cpr is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the appropriateness of cpr has been questioned as a matter of the outcome the patient is preferences and the cost <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> arguments cpr is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> according to beauchamp and childress the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories principles rules and particular judgements and actions <EOS>
<SOS> the decision to start cpr is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest <EOS>
<SOS> the decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive cpr <EOS>
<SOS> moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles <EOS>
<SOS> the principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare <EOS>
<SOS> talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success as many victims of pre and in hospital sudden death have been saved in the past <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases involving the principle of nonmaleficence <EOS>
<SOS> there is potential harm in cpr <EOS>
<SOS> survivors may recover cardiac function but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage at worst surviving without awakening for months or years <EOS>
<SOS> in particular post traumatic cpr is associated with an extremely poor outcome leading to the issue of futility <EOS>
<SOS> however futility should be defined in a strict fashion as there might be an individual chance of survival <EOS>
<SOS> the principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness <EOS>
<SOS> the time frame in cpr requires medical decision making within seconds and cpr is usually initiated without the patient is involvement <EOS>
<SOS> if the patient is wish is can be ascertained later on life sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time <EOS>
<SOS> terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no cpr document which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene <EOS>
<SOS> the principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources <EOS>
<SOS> the decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the standard of care remains the prompt initiation of cpr <EOS>
<SOS> however ethical principles such as beneficene nonmaleficence autonomy and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine <EOS>
<SOS> physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of cpr the potential risks and the patient is preferences <EOS>
<SOS> acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting out <EOS>
<SOS> subtile behaviour too as a part of the complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals sandler which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting out or microacting out treuniet <EOS>
<SOS> however this delicate acting has no meaning it is not symbolic or communicative action <EOS>
<SOS> it is aimed at inducing effects and interactions <EOS>
<SOS> it appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process <EOS>
<SOS> diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way <EOS>
<SOS> the acting reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations by which he unintentionally demonstrates in what a way he understands the patient <EOS>
<SOS> background the therapy of phimosis is circumcision <EOS>
<SOS> since many years it has been discussed whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls <EOS>

<SOS> findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast enhanced colour doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies <EOS>
<SOS> however the quantification of the increase in colour doppler signals after levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator resulting in a subjective scoring system <EOS>
<SOS> a computer assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour doppler signal after contrast media administration <EOS>
<SOS> after microbubble contrast medium injection in <NUM> patients carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree onset and duration of doppler enhancement <EOS>
<SOS> however the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> rapid image acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure <EOS>

<SOS> we discuss the pathology of deglutition in <NUM> patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro and hypopharynx <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition <EOS>
<SOS> our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases <EOS>
<SOS> people who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives <EOS>
<SOS> this leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient is life satisfaction long term rehabilitation outcome and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential <EOS>
<SOS> this necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat e g <EOS>
<SOS> confrontation with one is own dying <EOS>
<SOS> different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts erupting emotions parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one is future <EOS>
<SOS> whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages but essentially on their persistence <EOS>
<SOS> it is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior stage consistent interventions and a positive feedback <EOS>
<SOS> a failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke <EOS>

<SOS> the current adjustment of cochlear implant ci speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits t and c levels for electrical stimulus currents <EOS>
<SOS> these data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients <EOS>
<SOS> in cases with non reliable patient responses objective methods are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> especially for the estimation of correct t levels auditory evoked potentials aep can be applied since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency specific manner <EOS>
<SOS> by determining the aep of different latencies late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination <EOS>
<SOS> these patients have been examined in <NUM> patients provided with 22 or 8 channel ci systems nucleus or med el implants <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected <EOS>
<SOS> by making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field subjective hearing threshold and the t levels of electrical stimulation could be verified <EOS>
<SOS> since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system <EOS>

<SOS> complications arising from the operative technique are perforation early pouch dilatation gastric slippage infections of the port and the band erosion and defects of the band tube <EOS>
<SOS> insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> cases reoperations were necessary <EOS>
<SOS> obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance <EOS>

<SOS> methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in vivo manipulations <EOS>
<SOS> among these the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection <EOS>
<SOS> to determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined <EOS>
<SOS> based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed <EOS>

<SOS> an increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features clinical diameter greater than <NUM> cm low degree of keratinization high degree of cellular polymorphism high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index metastases only from tumor thickness 2 4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration desmoplasia and ulceration <EOS>
<SOS> consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment <EOS>
<SOS> multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high and low risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow up procedures <EOS>
<SOS> surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization <EOS>
<SOS> for a transcatheter closure however x ray exposure has been indispensable <EOS>
<SOS> we report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> in field research training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates <EOS>
<SOS> the subjects twelve women from <NUM> to <NUM> years old were tested once a week three times over three minutes with a break of three minutes three weeks in all <EOS>
<SOS> the sequence of the dances changed every week <EOS>
<SOS> measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> in this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a finapres device and correlating this with the r r intervals of the ecg after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of norfenefrinhydrochlorid novadral <EOS>
<SOS> according to other investigators a correlation of 0 7 with a significance of p0 05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity 3 ms mm hg being judged as decreased <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated <NUM> patients mean age <NUM> <NUM> years <NUM> males <NUM> females <EOS>
<SOS> 75 of the investigations showed acceptable results <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases 25 reasonable results could not be achieved <EOS>
<SOS> we found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in <NUM> investigations 6 of all investigations <EOS>
<SOS> 41 13 1 of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason <EOS>
<SOS> when we looked closely at these nonevaluable results we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction 40 diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group <EOS>
<SOS> embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina <EOS>
<SOS> only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix where they are most commonly seen in adolescence <EOS>
<SOS> their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in irs stage ia in a 32 year old female <EOS>
<SOS> after surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1993 <NUM> grade 3b open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail urtn n 22 or an external fixator fix n 19 <EOS>
<SOS> the method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> three below the knee amputations were performed three patients died and three were lost to follow up <EOS>
<SOS> in all <NUM> patients were followed up to union or at least for <NUM> year <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant statistical differences between the two groups p0 2 chi squared t test with respect to fracture type fracture location age gender or accompanying injuries <EOS>

<SOS> superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations essential telangiectases port wine stains poikiloderma of civatte hemangiomatous malformations and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source <EOS>
<SOS> catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> however the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy <EOS>
<SOS> with catheter ablation av block ii ° pulmonary embolism pericardial tamponade in some cases followed by death arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described <EOS>
<SOS> especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown <EOS>
<SOS> the risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class <NUM> and class <NUM> antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia <EOS>
<SOS> background chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea <EOS>
<SOS> the appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo <EOS>
<SOS> dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms climato therapy baths phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments <EOS>
<SOS> which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness <EOS>
<SOS> accordingly a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide <EOS>
<SOS> in addtion dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays and also depression pre existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> finally patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit <EOS>
<SOS> we report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a <NUM> year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> by right bundle bloc like qrs complexes in the surface ecg the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal ecg <EOS>
<SOS> this was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability <EOS>
<SOS> during this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats <EOS>
<SOS> an oral medical therapy with sotalol was started <EOS>
<SOS> after the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against vt <EOS>
<SOS> so the decision was made for ventricular ablation <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> high frequency applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced <EOS>
<SOS> since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> the vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone <EOS>
<SOS> the pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the corticalis <EOS>
<SOS> the ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and with exception of the lig <EOS>
<SOS> longitudinale anterius horizontal oblique segmental ligament bundles <EOS>
<SOS> in combination with the anulus fibrosus the ligaments work as a kind of gear system <EOS>
<SOS> they regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion <EOS>
<SOS> besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies <EOS>
<SOS> the intervertebral joints are important for guided motion by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions <EOS>
<SOS> because of their position they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes <EOS>
<SOS> the integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles <EOS>
<SOS> prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> these skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia <EOS>
<SOS> hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom <EOS>
<SOS> risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade with some variation in results partly with geographical region <EOS>
<SOS> four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the central malignant melanoma registry of the german dermatological society these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development <EOS>
<SOS> the numbers of common melanocytic naevi of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development <EOS>
<SOS> additional factors were hair colour skin type and a history of naevus growth <EOS>
<SOS> a classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout <EOS>
<SOS> for example in individuals with more than <NUM> common melanocytic naevi <NUM> or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100 fold that in persons with <NUM> common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines <EOS>
<SOS> early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore intermittent intensive sun exposure sunburns as indicator before the age of <NUM> induces the development of melanocytic naevi and after the age of <NUM> it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development <EOS>
<SOS> problem clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not <EOS>
<SOS> method children born between <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> 1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound <EOS>
<SOS> the data were analysed by spss pc <EOS>
<SOS> results <NUM> children with <NUM> <NUM> hips were examined <EOS>
<SOS> 85 were mature type i <NUM> were physiologically immature type iia and <NUM> were pathological iic d iia <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison shows that from <NUM> hips with pathological ultrasound findings only <NUM> 37 had positive clinical findings <EOS>
<SOS> a screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors positive family history or breech position would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time <EOS>
<SOS> the interpretation of three dimensional 3d structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two dimensional 2d images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy <EOS>
<SOS> although in the conventional analysis of 2d display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic anatomic coronary tree in only 50 60 of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> hence the mental integration ob both 2d images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels <EOS>
<SOS> for an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions we have developed a 3d fusion image technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> cause and effect relationships may be more obvious with 3d data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology <EOS>
<SOS> the physician is duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor is profession <EOS>
<SOS> it is laid down in the physicians professional code and determined ultimately by the patient is right to self determination which is regulated in §203 of the german criminal code <EOS>
<SOS> it is established in the ordinance governing physicians work and has its origin in the patient is right of self determination <EOS>
<SOS> it is also regulated in §203 of the german criminal code <EOS>
<SOS> an exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law <EOS>
<SOS> some such exceptions are also specified in the german social code although the physician is duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned <EOS>
<SOS> borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day to day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them and some hints are given on how this can be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 56 year old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin a immunosuppression <EOS>
<SOS> during this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms squamous cell carcinomas basal cell carcinomas bowen is disease actinic keratosis sebaceous hyperplasia a dysplastic naevus and finally a nodular malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> adverse effects of the cyclosporin a therapy are discussed with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor <EOS>
<SOS> with multislice spiral computed tomography msct existing indications for performing ct of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging <EOS>
<SOS> the high speed of msct improves efficiency image quality and patient comfort of routine imaging of the chest <EOS>
<SOS> the ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high quality secondary reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> if a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired msct for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high resolution hrct sections from the same set of thin collimation raw data <EOS>
<SOS> this way contiguous chest images of superior and hrct sections of equal image quality compared to conventional ct scanning can be obtained <EOS>
<SOS> vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of msct for imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli pe the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced <EOS>
<SOS> owing to thin collimation the detection rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased <EOS>
<SOS> if indicated the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session without additional contrast material <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> basis of the modern shoulder implants is the neer ii system a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> the second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the neer ii prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head and shaft sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation translation mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> the third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation <EOS>
<SOS> the latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3 dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry <EOS>
<SOS> this achieves a 3 dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane <EOS>
<SOS> besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established the replacement of the humeral head articular surface <EOS>
<SOS> a hemispheric surface prosthesis cup arthroplasty is cemented onto the residual humeral head which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal <EOS>
<SOS> bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi rotational head system <EOS>
<SOS> their indication is limited to pre existing lesions of the rotator cuff and or the glenoid surface <EOS>
<SOS> the inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid <EOS>
<SOS> the hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component <EOS>
<SOS> this implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences <EOS>
<SOS> the role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration <EOS>
<SOS> a fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus the centre of rotation and the anatomical retroversion <EOS>
<SOS> positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process <EOS>
<SOS> a failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result <EOS>
<SOS> the shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented cementless or hybrid techniques <EOS>
<SOS> today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist <EOS>
<SOS> their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups the keel and the peg shaped glenoid components <EOS>
<SOS> the peg shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear forces <EOS>
<SOS> cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal back with an integrated fixation system <EOS>
<SOS> these fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self cutting cage screw systems <EOS>
<SOS> the critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the pe inlay and the metal back because of high force development <EOS>
<SOS> the question of implanting a hemi or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease and the age of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work up x ray ct or mri to accurately assess the glenoid morphology <EOS>
<SOS> g walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations <EOS>
<SOS> to compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement <EOS>
<SOS> looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the neer total shoulder prosthesis has a <NUM> year survival rate of <NUM> compared to <NUM> of the hemi prosthesis <EOS>
<SOS> the objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures <EOS>
<SOS> another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components <EOS>
<SOS> a fairly new research field is the computer assisted surgery e g navigation systems and robotics <EOS>
<SOS> the computer assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane inclination and restroversion of the humeral head <EOS>
<SOS> the use of a surgery robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid <EOS>
<SOS> two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on <EOS>
<SOS> one case is well documented <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases there was very good functional adaptation resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement <EOS>
<SOS> the rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage <EOS>
<SOS> the function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed <EOS>
<SOS> johann friedrich dieffenbach <MOB> is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> one focus of his work apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery <EOS>
<SOS> this special aspect of plastic surgery as well as dieffenbach is biography is presented in this historic article <EOS>
<SOS> when a lifeless person is found in a bath tub the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance <EOS>

<SOS> any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer <EOS>
<SOS> these procedures were applied to <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative work up included gastric endoscopy barium x ray examination endoscopic ultrasonography and histological examination and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection emr was difficult <EOS>
<SOS> laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion lifting method by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full thickness gastric wall was carried out in the <NUM> patients with lesions of the anterior wall lesser curvature and greater curvature of the stomach <EOS>
<SOS> on pathological examination of resected specimens the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the histological depth of the lesions was m mucosal cancer in <NUM> patients and sm1 slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer in one <EOS>
<SOS> this one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found <EOS>
<SOS> oral nutrition was resumed for a mean <NUM> sd of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days after operation and the duration of hospitalization after operation was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection <EOS>
<SOS> laparotomy was required in <NUM> of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical margins were negative in all <NUM> patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful <EOS>
<SOS> lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2 both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region total gastrectomy was avoided and careful observation is continued <EOS>
<SOS> oral nutrition was resumed <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days after operation and the duration of hospitalization after operation was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> in addition no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow up period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> selected properly these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1997 tumor resection was carried out in <NUM> irradiated patients group <NUM> 36 72 gy <NUM> implants and <NUM> nonirradiated patients group <NUM> <NUM> implants in the mandible and floor of the mouth and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients were treated with exclusively implant supported prostheses and <NUM> with implant tissue supported constructions <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1991 group <NUM> and <NUM> patients received implant tissue supported prostheses using two to four implants <EOS>
<SOS> due to prosthesis related pressure lesions the strategy has now been changed <EOS>
<SOS> since 1992 group <NUM> patients have received exclusively implant supported prostheses using five to six implants while group <NUM> patients have received implant tissue supported constructions using four implants <EOS>
<SOS> special criteria for the success of implant supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up <EOS>
<SOS> with an average follow up period of <NUM> months <NUM> fixtures 91 were clinically osseointegrated <EOS>
<SOS> both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> however only completely implant supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers <EOS>
<SOS> the overall success rate was about 77 after <NUM> years in group <NUM> and about 87 after <NUM> years in group <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to implants placed after strategy change the 5 year success rate was approximately 86 group 1 and 94 group 2 <EOS>
<SOS> in irradiated patients an exclusively implant supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis should therefore be fabricated <EOS>
<SOS> implant tissue supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients <EOS>
<SOS> extracorporal shock wave therapy eswt has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> following <NUM> cycles of eswt with <NUM> impulses 18 kv the reevaluation was performed at 1 <NUM> and <NUM> months after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> pseudarthroses was reevaluated in <NUM> one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to eswt <EOS>
<SOS> following eswt we found a success rate of <NUM> n 11 <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical evidence of subjective clinical improvement was found in <NUM> of these patients within <NUM> month in all of these patients within a period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within <NUM> month in all of these patients within <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> eswt appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion <EOS>
<SOS> if no improvement occurs the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months <EOS>
<SOS> over a period of <NUM> years a total of <NUM> liver resections for non colorectal non neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in <NUM> patients 73 women <NUM> men median age <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> first <NUM> second and <NUM> third liver resections <EOS>
<SOS> primary tumors were breast cancer n 34 leiomyosarcoma n 20 pancreatic cancer n 16 renal cell carcinoma n 13 melanoma n 9 gastric cancer n 9 lung cancer n 6 and adrenal cancer n 6 and miscellaneous tumors n 14 <EOS>
<SOS> extrahepatic tumor manifestation including synchronous primary tumors was found in 69 140 cases 49 <NUM> of <NUM> patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor 51 <EOS>
<SOS> in the <NUM> first liver resections <NUM> 68 r0 <NUM> 11 r1 and <NUM> 21 r2 excisions were possible <EOS>
<SOS> median survival after first liver resection was <NUM> months after r0 resection a median survival of <NUM> months and after r1 2 resection of <NUM> months was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 year survival rate was <NUM> for the total group <NUM> in patients with r0 resection and <NUM> for r1 2 resections <EOS>
<SOS> after a second liver resection n 14 there was a median survival of <NUM> months 5 year survival rate of <NUM> for all patients and of <NUM> months 5 year survival rate <NUM> after r0 resection <EOS>
<SOS> morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were <NUM> and <NUM> respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of <NUM> months 5 year survival rate <NUM> and <NUM> months was achieved after r0 resection and r1 2 resection respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was <NUM> months 5 year survival rate <NUM> for r0 resection compared to <NUM> months after r1 2 resection <EOS>
<SOS> these data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a r0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that patients with liver metastases of non colorectal non neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection <EOS>
<SOS> similar to colorectal metastases a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases <EOS>
<SOS> even in more unfavorable tumor entities several cases of long term survival were observed after surgical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case <EOS>
<SOS> generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow up <EOS>
<SOS> the present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long term psychotherapy typically psychoanalytically oriented in private practice <EOS>
<SOS> the design was a three wave panel comprising more than <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> at the end of the third wave <NUM> patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample <EOS>
<SOS> across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years before during and after treatment the <NUM> psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development whereas the development among the <NUM> psychotherapy cases was moderately positive <EOS>
<SOS> the findings emphasize the importance of extended follow up <EOS>
<SOS> when therapist variables are considered therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome <EOS>
<SOS> especially positive were high age and many years in private practice after licensing <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support friendliness etc <EOS>
<SOS> therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> it is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different <EOS>
<SOS> experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin ivig as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ms <EOS>
<SOS> the austrian immunoglobulin in multiple sclerosis aims study tested this assumption by examining <NUM> patients with relapsing remitting ms in a randomized double blind placebo controlled fashion 75 ivig <NUM> placebo <EOS>
<SOS> monthly administration of ivig in a dosage of <MOB> g kg over a period of <NUM> years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24 of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first <NUM> months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance at study entry <EOS>
<SOS> overall the magnitude of treatment effects of ivig was comparable to that reported for beta interferon and copolymer <NUM> <EOS>

<SOS> spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> incidence etiology and optimal treatment are ill defined <EOS>
<SOS> between july <NUM> and december 1997 we prospectively identified <NUM> patients 36 men six women mean age <NUM> <NUM> years with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among <NUM> consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time incidence 1 1 <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris 8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among <NUM> patients incidence 0 3 the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction 13 450 2 9 and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina 21 501 4 2 <EOS>
<SOS> dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery 19 cases followed by the right coronary artery 15 cases and the left circumflex coronary artery 8 cases <EOS>
<SOS> because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in <NUM> patients to confirm the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in <NUM> cases heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases no obvious risk factor could be identified <EOS>
<SOS> therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in <NUM> patients including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction coronary artery bypass grafting cabg in <NUM> patients and balloon angioplasty ptca in seven patients <EOS>
<SOS> three patients were treated conservatively <EOS>
<SOS> introduction since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the tapp procedure transabdominal preperitoneal approach has become the most widely used technique <EOS>
<SOS> many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach tep because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion <EOS>
<SOS> method we evaluated our results with tapp in a retrospective study with special attention to complications caused by the approach <EOS>
<SOS> we operated on <NUM> hernias in <NUM> patients in a period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> results complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after tep <EOS>
<SOS> there was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years <EOS>
<SOS> there were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion we see no reason to change from tapp to the tep technique <EOS>
<SOS> this article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines automatic teller machines atms and telephone cards by the elderly in four european regions <EOS>
<SOS> the analyses are based on data from an international project entitled keeping the elderly mobile collected in mannheim former west germany n 404 home dwelling respondents chemnitz former east germany n 400 ancona italy n 600 and jyväskylä finland n 618 <EOS>
<SOS> the random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country <EOS>
<SOS> two generations of men and women aged 55 74 and 75 years respectively participated in the study <EOS>
<SOS> results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation in fact the majority of respondents does not use them at all <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequently used devices were atms in chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in mannheim <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of logistic regression analysis age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions i e the users were mostly the young old <EOS>
<SOS> education was a more important variable than gender <EOS>
<SOS> in all four regions the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier nevertheless ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in mannheim <EOS>
<SOS> interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found <EOS>
<SOS> the present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth <EOS>
<SOS> in order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression a single blind placebo controlled study with <NUM> inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin <EOS>
<SOS> the verum group n 22 received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression <EOS>
<SOS> the placebo group n 24 was treated with acupuncture at non specific locations and the control group n 24 received only pharmacological treatment <EOS>
<SOS> acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks <EOS>
<SOS> psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the cgi gas brms and bfs rating scales <EOS>
<SOS> additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself <EOS>
<SOS> however we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture <EOS>
<SOS> acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock <EOS>
<SOS> while decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated <EOS>
<SOS> cardiogenic shock however is still a therapeutic challenge <EOS>
<SOS> for therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes phosphodiesterase inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use <EOS>
<SOS> if it is not possible to correct underlying diseases mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high <EOS>
<SOS> two years after the diagnosis of sézary syndrome a 50 year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet leading to acral necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> another 59 year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet secondary to ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> this was the first symptom of a t cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia <EOS>
<SOS> similar cases have only occasionally been described <EOS>
<SOS> the relationship between acral ischemia and t cell lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma <EOS>
<SOS> we report our findings in a 57 year old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma <EOS>
<SOS> a large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits <EOS>
<SOS> both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> the development of a progressive facial palsy within <NUM> weeks of presentation and an atypi cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma <EOS>
<SOS> such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures <EOS>
<SOS> manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare <EOS>
<SOS> to our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with sjögren is syndrome has never been reported before <EOS>
<SOS> cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin particularly the problem of vital agonal supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters including poisonous plants and animals drugs and toxic substances <EOS>
<SOS> the time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol p or methohexital m for elective magnetic resonance imaging mri in children with respect to safety side effects recovery and discharge time <EOS>
<SOS> pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent complication is hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> of these the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications and they have an extremely poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> within <NUM> months <NUM> patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients 6 1 the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis <EOS>
<SOS> two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery <EOS>
<SOS> one patient died the other survived but was severely disabled <EOS>
<SOS> the latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned <EOS>
<SOS> these worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> local selective or superselective thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 61 year old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease <EOS>
<SOS> the congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of post endocarditic insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life <EOS>
<SOS> it was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization <EOS>
<SOS> the physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> due to its high prevalence atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice <EOS>
<SOS> the chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our department of dermatology <EOS>
<SOS> a high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care <EOS>
<SOS> the aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis the gathering of epidemiologic data the performance of controlled studies and potentially the reduction of costs <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head injured patients <EOS>
<SOS> we present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the a1 a2 junction <EOS>
<SOS> purpose although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear <EOS>
<SOS> recent oct studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc <EOS>
<SOS> none of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven <EOS>
<SOS> besides the hypothesis of exudation the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow up of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits <EOS>
<SOS> sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion which was not recognized until a few years ago <EOS>
<SOS> as in sclerosing adenosis of the breast a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate <EOS>
<SOS> an incidence of <NUM> was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands <EOS>
<SOS> as demonstrated in this case report the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate <EOS>
<SOS> histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine he sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods <EOS>
<SOS> important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903 and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation with expression of s 100 and or smooth muscle actin <EOS>
<SOS> these antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible even after the application of immunohistochemical methods <EOS>
<SOS> further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate <EOS>
<SOS> so far there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to malignant complications so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance <EOS>
<SOS> our investigation summarizes a 10 year experience after surgical treatment of <NUM> patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in <NUM> cases in <NUM> cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> the main symptom in <NUM> patients was dyspnea <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases an embolic event occurred <EOS>
<SOS> all patients underwent extirpation of the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> early mortality was <NUM> while late mortality was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation which due to unpredictable embolic complications is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface <EOS>
<SOS> in such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance <EOS>
<SOS> we present a case of a <NUM> year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe <EOS>
<SOS> radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung <EOS>
<SOS> biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes <EOS>
<SOS> these tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed hmb 45 and protein s 100 immunohistochemically <EOS>
<SOS> malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> a thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed <EOS>
<SOS> the lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases <EOS>
<SOS> lipoma leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express hmb 45 <EOS>
<SOS> this has not been reported yet <EOS>
<SOS> background the maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non dividing senescent at least <EOS>
<SOS> this replicative life span also known as hayflick limit is probably defined by a critical length of the telomeres <EOS>
<SOS> telomeres are special dna sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle <EOS>
<SOS> cells of most but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed hayflick limit can be overcome and unlimited cell division can be established <EOS>
<SOS> this study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal mp joint of the thumb were treated surgically between <NUM> and 1985 <NUM> patients were followed up after a mean period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> of <NUM> patients with acute injuries <NUM> were painfree with full stability of the mp joint <NUM> patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired <EOS>
<SOS> the results of follow up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography sct and magnetic resonance imaging mri in the preoperative work up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma regarding local resectability and vascular involvement <EOS>
<SOS> methods and materials a total of <NUM> patients 19 men and <NUM> women mean age <NUM> years with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study <EOS>
<SOS> all patients prospectively underwent mri <NUM> gadolinium dtpa and sct 3 phase examination as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies and laparotomy was carried out within <NUM> days irrespective of the mri or sct findings <EOS>
<SOS> sct and mr studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists without knowing the results of the surgical exploration <EOS>
<SOS> standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy <EOS>
<SOS> results laparotomy identified <NUM> patients to be suitable for surgical resection and <NUM> pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of <NUM> non resectable carcinomas mri and sct were able to obtain correct information about unresectability sensitivity <NUM> in <NUM> mri resp <EOS>
<SOS> 8 sct carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable sensitivity <NUM> for mri and <NUM> for sct <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of vascular involvement was depicted by sct with a sensitivity of <MOB> and <MOB> by mri <EOS>
<SOS> the specificity varied between <MOB> for sct and <MOB> for mri <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion both mri and sct are good techniques for the preoperative work up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability <EOS>
<SOS> pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis with a spontaneous resolution rate of <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions <EOS>
<SOS> careful diagnostic work up including ercp and ct scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications <EOS>
<SOS> pain is present in up to <NUM> of all patients and the rate of complications varies between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis <EOS>
<SOS> pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment <EOS>
<SOS> new percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> however so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> a 28 year old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis simultaneously hepatitis a persistent hepatitis b hepatitis c and superinfection by delta hepatitis <EOS>
<SOS> liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis compatible with a delta virus infection <EOS>
<SOS> moderate pulmonary fat embolism grade i ii according to falzi was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages <EOS>
<SOS> it is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages <EOS>
<SOS> suicide on railways either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train is one of the hardest suicide methods <EOS>
<SOS> in austria <NUM> suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this amounts to <NUM> of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men <EOS>
<SOS> in both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups the mean age was higher in women than in men 48 0 vs <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> there was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides <EOS>
<SOS> persuading the mass media to treat the subject of suicide with reserve and with greater caution even when not presenting a distinct suicide model may be of importance in general suicide prevention <EOS>
<SOS> for decades the results of elective lymph node dissection elnd are differently discussed so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation ca not be neglected <EOS>
<SOS> since the beginning of <NUM> we practice a gamma probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy slne on patients with melanoma from a breslow tumor thickness of <NUM> mm upward after injecting a colloidal 99m tc labelled tin ii sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar if the tumor has been excided before <EOS>
<SOS> by this method that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage i or ii uicc but even histopathologically to a stage ii and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes the sentinel node can be exactly localised tissue sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity <EOS>
<SOS> when finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows <EOS>
<SOS> during rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well being n 87 age <NUM> to 94 <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases a deterioration of subjective well being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented the well being improved in most cases <EOS>
<SOS> when discharged the subjective well being of our patients was comparable to the well being of similar aged people living at home <EOS>
<SOS> antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non cognitive symptoms including agitation aggression and irritability <EOS>
<SOS> as patients are usually elderly a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants <EOS>
<SOS> new antidepressants such as the ssris and the reversible mao inhibitors should be the first line agents in these patients because their efficacy is not different from that of classic tca but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects ease of use and safety <EOS>
<SOS> improvement in cognitive performance however may not be expected from the new antidepressants <EOS>
<SOS> for the treatment of agitation aggression and irritabiltiy antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens <EOS>
<SOS> good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram <EOS>
<SOS> all medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously <EOS>
<SOS> the application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule <EOS>
<SOS> primary clinical results of combined laser assisted capsular shrinkage lacs and multiple suture repair caspari for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented <EOS>
<SOS> from july <NUM> to october 1998 <NUM> patients 2 female <NUM> male mean age <NUM> years range 16 42 years with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule caspari and lacs <EOS>
<SOS> laser energy was applied using a ho yag laser 10 w <NUM> j <NUM> pulses s total energy <MOB> j <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were followed for an average of <NUM> months range 4 20 months <EOS>
<SOS> from june <NUM> to februrary 1996 arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on <NUM> patients 2 female <NUM> male age <NUM> years range 18 37 years <EOS>
<SOS> the average follow up in this group was <NUM> years range 2 5 5 years and we found 41 2 7 17 recurrent dislocations <EOS>
<SOS> after combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair caspari and lacs a significantly chi squared test p 0 05 lower recurrence rate was obtained <EOS>
<SOS> only in one patient 5 6 1 18 did we find this failure <EOS>
<SOS> no complications occurred in either group <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of arthroscopic lacs and caspari is technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising <EOS>
<SOS> although no long term results are available the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> simple bone cysts are asymptomatic benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph <EOS>
<SOS> etiology and treatment are controversially discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made <EOS>
<SOS> we present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma <EOS>
<SOS> several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested <EOS>
<SOS> the question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed <EOS>
<SOS> it is the author is opinion that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment <EOS>
<SOS> facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated <EOS>
<SOS> twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week <EOS>
<SOS> the study group consisted of <NUM> males and <NUM> females <EOS>
<SOS> ages ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was <NUM> ma on average <EOS>
<SOS> the mean of the intra individual side to side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32 5 <EOS>
<SOS> results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80 side to side differences in the same individual <EOS>
<SOS> the hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data <EOS>
<SOS> as with previous investigators we found significant side to side differences in healthy subjects <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography <EOS>
<SOS> to compare patient dose and image quality of electron beam ct vs spiral ct by means of phantom measurements <EOS>
<SOS> an ebct scanner c 150 xp and a spiral ct scanner ge <NUM> hispeed advantage were used to scan three different phantoms <EOS>
<SOS> administered dose high contrast hc resolution low contrast lc lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured <EOS>
<SOS> ebct showed 25 35 lower hc resolution in comparison to spiral ct lc lesion detectability showed equivalent results for s n vs patient dose using <NUM> mm collimation with ebct and spiral ct whereas spiral ct was superior for 1 5 and <NUM> mm collimation <EOS>
<SOS> dose measurements revealed a <NUM> fold higher patient dose using ebct with 1 5 mm or <NUM> mm collimation compared to spiral ct using equivalent scan parameters <EOS>
<SOS> no differences were seen using <NUM> mm collimation <EOS>
<SOS> differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the ebct <EOS>
<SOS> the use of ebct with <NUM> mm collimation should be avoided because of impaired performance <EOS>
<SOS> using <NUM> mm collimation ebct showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral ct despite lower hc resolution <EOS>
<SOS> in an experimental study the biomechanical qualities of the combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis kwo in the unstable colles fracture were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> this type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable colles fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy <EOS>
<SOS> it represents a modification of kapandji is dynamic kwo compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static kwo <EOS>
<SOS> clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined kwo and its single components should be constituted <EOS>
<SOS> simulation of the unstable colles fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material <EOS>
<SOS> this fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different kwo types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions <EOS>
<SOS> the combined kwo unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional kwo with the high dorsal stability of dynamic kwo <EOS>
<SOS> the main functional principle of dynamic kwo with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission <EOS>
<SOS> besides its good stabilization dynamic kwo also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies <EOS>
<SOS> based on these experimental findings the surgical technique of combined kwo was standardized <EOS>
<SOS> purpose it is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction <EOS>
<SOS> this is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 2 year old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face <EOS>
<SOS> the clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child <EOS>
<SOS> because of the morphological findings the medico legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven <EOS>
<SOS> during the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico legal expert became obvious <EOS>
<SOS> findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment <EOS>
<SOS> the opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted <EOS>
<SOS> during the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal in dubio pro reo <EOS>
<SOS> anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> lesions treated were located between t4 and l3 most frequently occuring at t12 l2 <EOS>
<SOS> operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure <EOS>
<SOS> 2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure <EOS>
<SOS> one positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the l1 root at the entrance site were both transitory <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative control by x ray and ctscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft as well as the fixation device in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method <EOS>
<SOS> major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach postoperative pain reduction early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay <EOS>
<SOS> in order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective study the indication growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared <EOS>
<SOS> in total <NUM> patients 4 14 years old <NUM> female <NUM> male with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts 7 costochondral <NUM> iliac crest observation period 4 9 years <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients <MOB> years old <NUM> female <NUM> male distraction osteogenesis was performed observation period <NUM> months to <NUM> 1 2 years <EOS>
<SOS> in the results according to the literature the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected <EOS>
<SOS> after osteochondral grafts adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> in all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necessary <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate the predictive value of mri in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement a prospective study was performed <EOS>
<SOS> twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast enhanced mri 2 12 <NUM> weeks <NUM> and <NUM> years postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by lysholm oak and ikdc <EOS>
<SOS> the mri scans sp 63 <NUM> tesla were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament <EOS>
<SOS> during the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in mri was observed in <NUM> patients with an average value for signal noise of <NUM> <NUM> weeks postoperatively up to <NUM> <NUM> year postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1 year postoperative mri whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability <EOS>
<SOS> in the 2 year postoperative mri the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement <EOS>
<SOS> miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today <EOS>
<SOS> apart from easy handling in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent <EOS>
<SOS> titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures <EOS>
<SOS> compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry <EOS>
<SOS> the titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates <EOS>
<SOS> as a result complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent <EOS>
<SOS> non invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> myocardial scintigraphy using thallium 201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism using fluorine 18 fluoro deoxyglucose are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability <EOS>
<SOS> besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events <EOS>
<SOS> this short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> an elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed <EOS>

<SOS> the investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder <EOS>
<SOS> the autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis <EOS>
<SOS> the woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> a similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described <EOS>
<SOS> in the ankle talocrural joint the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali <EOS>
<SOS> thus an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg <EOS>
<SOS> due to the geometry of the trochlea tali conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint <EOS>
<SOS> movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments <EOS>
<SOS> talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations <EOS>
<SOS> the posterior articulation is the subtalar talocalcaneal joint in the anterior articulation talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head <EOS>
<SOS> thus the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and like the subtalar joint a multiaxial articulation <EOS>
<SOS> on the weight bearing foot the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact <EOS>
<SOS> when the foot is off the ground these movements are modified to eversion and inversion also involving the calcaneocuboid joint <EOS>
<SOS> in addition movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore and hindfoot <EOS>
<SOS> limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments <EOS>
<SOS> finally the cuneonavicular cuboideonavicular intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground <EOS>
<SOS> a case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers cd 31 cd 34 factor vii associated antigen and express also histiocytic antigens cd 68 lysozyme cathepsin d alpha 1 antitrypsin alpha 1 antichymotrypsin as well as cd <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with <NUM> histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma <EOS>
<SOS> despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in the university hospital of kiel germany an anaesthesiology based acute pain service aps was started in <NUM> to improve this situation <EOS>
<SOS> the anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an aps for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant <EOS>
<SOS> the anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours <EOS>
<SOS> the activities of the aps are as follows <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients <EOS>
<SOS> clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia ea other forms of regional analgesia or patient controlled analgesia pca every morning and throughout the day if necessary <EOS>
<SOS> additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request <EOS>
<SOS> assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient quality of analgesia and side effects <EOS>
<SOS> writing orders for further treatment <EOS>
<SOS> continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses physiotherapists and surgical staff formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> to 1992 <NUM> patients on normal wards were treated ea 1736 pca 183 <EOS>
<SOS> epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0 175 0 25 infused continuously with top ups if needed mean <NUM> mg day range <NUM> <NUM> mg median duration <NUM> days range <NUM> 53 table 1 <EOS>
<SOS> demand for further treatment was proved by day to day withdrawal <EOS>
<SOS> since the introduction of an aps complications of ea such as hypotension 1985 1986 5 1 1987 1992 0 5 table 3 and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly table 3 <EOS>
<SOS> dermal infections were seen in 2 6 of patients with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases 4 1 <EOS>
<SOS> epidural opioids were used in only <NUM> selected cases on surgical wards <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless <NUM> cases of marked respiratory depression occurred <EOS>
<SOS> the overall risk of complications during postoperative ea could be reduced from <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> cases in the first <NUM> years to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> in the last <NUM> years since introducing the aps <EOS>
<SOS> for other regional procedures e g interpleural analgesia no complications were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> pca was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion table 6 <EOS>
<SOS> the loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit <EOS>
<SOS> the median duration of pca was <NUM> days range <NUM> 23 the median dose of piritramide was <NUM> mg day range <NUM> <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred <EOS>
<SOS> in this period there were <NUM> potential life threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy <NUM> occurred during standard surgical pain management 3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i m <EOS>
<SOS> piritramide unsuccessfull resuscitation tramadol and buprenorphine <NUM> small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication <EOS>
<SOS> in those cases the aps was not involved <EOS>
<SOS> there are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an aps i e i m <EOS>
<SOS> injections of opioids on request but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported <EOS>
<SOS> since the majority of patients used ea or pca for several days it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of an aps is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards <EOS>
<SOS> this requires standard protocols table 7 standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses <EOS>
<SOS> lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses <EOS>
<SOS> using the concept of fronto orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis <EOS>
<SOS> the process involves striped transversal osteotomy removal remodelling and advancement of the occipital region <EOS>
<SOS> it allows precise reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments <EOS>
<SOS> artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy <EOS>
<SOS> the remodelling leads to a well proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume <EOS>
<SOS> this article presents the operative method and the results of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin <EOS>
<SOS> it almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge <EOS>
<SOS> although it usually follows a benign course local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor <EOS>
<SOS> melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery <EOS>
<SOS> 10 15 of the lesions recur <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a 2 month old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation <EOS>
<SOS> computer assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures <EOS>
<SOS> several reports on clinical results of computer aided screw insertion in the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine as well as the sacro iliac joints are available <EOS>
<SOS> they show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques <EOS>
<SOS> over the past years antioxidants and particularly vitamin e have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in rheumatology interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> however the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new <EOS>
<SOS> as early as the sixties first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin e in the therapy of osteoarthritis <EOS>
<SOS> nonetheless most of the following studies were not conducted properly thus not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin e newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases mainly in the reduction of pain <EOS>
<SOS> this paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin e in the treatment of rheumatic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> patient controlled intravenous analgesia i v pca represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain <EOS>
<SOS> however in many countries i v pca is rarely used <EOS>
<SOS> recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we investigated patients acceptance and assessment of patient controlled intranasal analgesia pcina and compared it to intravenous pca and the customarily prescribed pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade ii and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage <EOS>
<SOS> however fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication <EOS>
<SOS> we report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails biorigid tibial nail aap utn ace stn howmedica tln howmedica r t tibial nail smith nephew ao asif utn synthes <EOS>
<SOS> our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt is diameter and mechanical properties <EOS>
<SOS> further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail is aperture <EOS>
<SOS> our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight 350n allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts <EOS>
<SOS> some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight bearing in a physiological walking cycle but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle <EOS>
<SOS> voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections <EOS>
<SOS> the urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> in the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed <EOS>
<SOS> behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role <EOS>
<SOS> therapy is based on behavioural modification <EOS>
<SOS> we report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone <EOS>
<SOS> dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug <EOS>
<SOS> before the introduction of isotretinoin dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne <EOS>
<SOS> to date its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described <EOS>
<SOS> when hematologic parameters are monitored dapsone is considered a safe and cost effective drug especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available <EOS>
<SOS> however the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthesia both for adenotomy at and for tonsillectomy te frequently presents a challenge <EOS>
<SOS> on one hand children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo and bronchospasm on the other hand the ent surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the workspace in the patient is mouth <EOS>
<SOS> since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism <EOS>
<SOS> following several years use of the mask for this purpose in at and te in young children we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic <EOS>
<SOS> the laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation provided there is close cooperation with the ent surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> topical corticosteroids cs are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected <EOS>
<SOS> however increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last <NUM> years and allergic skin reactions to over <NUM> particular compounds have been observed <EOS>
<SOS> cs must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men <EOS>
<SOS> contact allergy to cs is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent corticosteroid resistant dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> in general hypersensitivity to cs is a type i and or type iv mediated allergic reaction <EOS>
<SOS> cross sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures e g <EOS>
<SOS> hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate <EOS>
<SOS> contact allergy to cs can be confirmed by patch tests intradermal injection tests or application tests because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to <NUM> h is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> for routine screening the use of the patient is own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate <EOS>
<SOS> the development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research <EOS>
<SOS> the alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process <EOS>
<SOS> the historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts these being the implicit standard alliance of freud zetzel is therapeutic alliance and greenson is working alliance are to be described <EOS>
<SOS> all alliance concepts refer to a general essentially reality oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work <EOS>
<SOS> nonetheless the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference <EOS>
<SOS> the alliances are therefore not faced with the transference but rather with the resistance <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 15 months old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid dacryocystitides conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth retardation chronic obstipation and anal prolaps <EOS>
<SOS> during a period of <NUM> days absolute neutropenia was observed <EOS>
<SOS> retrospectively neutrophil counts were between 0 500 µl from birth on <EOS>
<SOS> bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes <EOS>
<SOS> continuous therapy with <NUM> <NUM> µg kg d of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf induced 12 day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts <EOS>
<SOS> there were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines <EOS>
<SOS> growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized and few intercurrent bacterial infections pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred <EOS>
<SOS> a mutation in the g csf receptor gene was not found in this patient <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> years of therapy a reduction of rhg csf dose application every <NUM> days lead to a severe neutropenia <EOS>
<SOS> we report a 31 year old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin a who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis <EOS>
<SOS> those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs <EOS>
<SOS> in some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found <EOS>
<SOS> the histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders <EOS>
<SOS> scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair like structure of these keratoses <EOS>
<SOS> some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material a finding similar to earlier observations <EOS>
<SOS> our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin a and that they are apparently dose dependent <EOS>
<SOS> background since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> we performed pupil stretching iridotomy with iris suture and partial sphincterectomy <EOS>
<SOS> reports of accidental alkaloid intoxications with plants of the nightshade family in <NUM> particular datura species are well known in pediatric care <EOS>
<SOS> the intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> two patients a 14 resp <EOS>
<SOS> 16 year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals <NUM> because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from angel is trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons <EOS>
<SOS> patient is history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission a routine immunological drug screening of the patient is urine had been negative <EOS>
<SOS> in the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41 year old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer <EOS>
<SOS> granular cell tumors abrikossoff is tumor of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> in the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes a correction factor of <NUM> has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood <EOS>
<SOS> the reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor <EOS>
<SOS> in a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of <NUM> samples which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act an average quotient of <NUM> was found with minimum and maximum values of <NUM> and <NUM> respectively <EOS>
<SOS> in 96 of the cases the quotient was between <NUM> and <NUM> and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3 <EOS>
<SOS> from these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed <EOS>
<SOS> in germany if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient is skin disorder is severe or chronic work related and requiring a change in occupation then he or she must issue a berufskrankheitenanzeige loosely translated as occupational disease notification <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is consent is not required for this mandatory form which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation then the dermatologist needs only write a hautarztbericht dermatologist is report <EOS>
<SOS> the patient is permission is required for this less formal document <EOS>
<SOS> bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors <EOS>
<SOS> sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples <EOS>
<SOS> like normal hematopoietic cells tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules <EOS>
<SOS> since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell cell and cell matrix interactions are conceivable <EOS>
<SOS> with the development of powerful computer systems computer assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> even in the surgical field computer and robotic assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis <EOS>
<SOS> in the orthopaedic field computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three dimensional osteotomies setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement <EOS>
<SOS> this article introduces a computer and robotic assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man is work <EOS>
<SOS> the multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality sensibility motor function and stability <EOS>
<SOS> in severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor <EOS>
<SOS> in a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand <EOS>
<SOS> the cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw <EOS>
<SOS> basically we recommend an extended primary repair <EOS>
<SOS> after the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures <EOS>
<SOS> we start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints <EOS>
<SOS> thereafter suturing of extensor and flexor tendons <EOS>
<SOS> then we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves <EOS>
<SOS> in case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap <EOS>
<SOS> in a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first <EOS>
<SOS> our results in vitality and sensibility are listed <EOS>
<SOS> in the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a 34 year old women had a hen is egg sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the main complaint about the axillary lump was that it was aesthetically displeasing and it was excised <EOS>
<SOS> the importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma <EOS>
<SOS> early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended <EOS>
<SOS> paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis <EOS>
<SOS> because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel is antitumor efficacy <EOS>
<SOS> four different mouse tumors two squamous cell carcinomas scc iv scc vii and two adenocarcinomas mca 4 mca 29 were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i c <EOS>
<SOS> tumor cells 5 x 105 were injected i c <EOS>
<SOS> into the skin flap over the abdominal wall and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2 4 6 8 <NUM> and <NUM> days later <EOS>
<SOS> the mice were treated with docetaxel taxotere <NUM> mg kg i v <EOS>
<SOS> 1 or <NUM> days after tumor cell injection <EOS>
<SOS> the number of new blood vessels increased with time <EOS>
<SOS> docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in mcas but not in sccs <EOS>
<SOS> the reduction was associated with slower tumor growth <EOS>
<SOS> in a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel is inhibitory effect on the two mcas was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> this was not observed for the two sccs <EOS>
<SOS> since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel is destruction of tumor cells <EOS>
<SOS> a patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica like skin changes <EOS>
<SOS> just as in the autosomal recessive disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement <EOS>
<SOS> a measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants <EOS>
<SOS> the implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear <EOS>
<SOS> a defined signal within the frequency range of 0 5 khz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is <NUM> measured by a probe microphone <EOS>
<SOS> displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of <NUM> nm <EOS>
<SOS> the transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal <EOS>
<SOS> this system can be used to evaluate the sound transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences such as surgical techniques <EOS>
<SOS> this work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound transmission of middle ear implants <EOS>
<SOS> in acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to ptca regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events <EOS>
<SOS> it is however uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary ptca and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result provisional stenting <EOS>
<SOS> in order to perform accurate low flow anaesthesia ventilation it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow fgf and inspiration duration id on the resulting minute volume mv <EOS>
<SOS> the sulla 808v anaesthesia ventilator draeger luebeck germany is originally not equipped with a fresh gas decoupling fgd device <EOS>
<SOS> therefore changes of fgf and id settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting mv <EOS>
<SOS> recently a low cost fgd device carbamed bern liebefeld switzerland has been developed which can be inserted into the circle system <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the effect of this device on mv in the sulla 808v anaesthesia apparatus <EOS>

<SOS> the diagnosis prader willi syndrome pws in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia <EOS>
<SOS> craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys for example cryptorchism are common and unspecific signs at that age <EOS>

<SOS> sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 100 year worldwide <EOS>
<SOS> most of these transplants have been performed in the united states <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the number of pancreas transplants performed in the eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years <EOS>
<SOS> the results of a consecutive series of <NUM> simultaneous pancreas kidney grafts spk performed between june <NUM> and october <NUM> demonstrate that high graft function rates of <NUM> for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved <EOS>

<SOS> intubation and positive end expiratory pressure ventilation peep is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function particularly following blunt chest trauma <EOS>
<SOS> complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as continuous positive airway pressure cpap have only gained minor popularity <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective study <NUM> patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with cpap administered by mask <EOS>
<SOS> the regime consisted of continuous administration of cpap by a face mask with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing <EOS>
<SOS> initially a fio2 of <NUM> range 0 28 0 38 proved necessary <EOS>
<SOS> the initial cpap level was <NUM> mbar range 5 8 with an assisted spontaneous breathing asb of <NUM> mbar range 13 18 <EOS>
<SOS> fio2 and cpap asb levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary <EOS>
<SOS> in all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average icu stay was dramatically reduced principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation <EOS>
<SOS> other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery both physical and psychological <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that non invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications <EOS>

<SOS> in the present study we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage perichondrium and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu nu mice <EOS>
<SOS> prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor bb pdgf bb but not transforming growth factor beta 1 tgf 1 basic fibroblast growth factor or bone morphogenetic protein 2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype <EOS>
<SOS> tgf 1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium <EOS>
<SOS> in addition pdgf bb has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly d l lactide co glycolide plg scaffolds <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation <EOS>
<SOS> scaffolds were manufactured from <NUM> plg with a <NUM> lactide glycolide ratio and <NUM> modified plg with a <NUM> lactide glycolide ratio plg h scaffolds <EOS>
<SOS> for each experimental group four nude mice received two identical implants one in each calf muscle resulting in an n <NUM> implants plg h scaffolds alone plg h scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage costochondral periochondrium or costochondral resting zone cartilage of <NUM> g male sprague dawley rats plg h scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37 5 ng ml rhpdgf bb for <NUM> h or <NUM> h before implantation or with perichondrial cells treated with pdgf bb plus 0 22 ng ml rhtgf 1 for <NUM> h and <NUM> h at <NUM> or <NUM> weeks after implantation samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue <EOS>
<SOS> only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study <EOS>
<SOS> there was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells <EOS>
<SOS> pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for <NUM> h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after <NUM> weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy <EOS>
<SOS> the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with pdgf bb was increased <EOS>
<SOS> the results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous plg scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non weight bearing site <EOS>
<SOS> articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model <EOS>
<SOS> bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the rate of proliferation of <NUM> bone tumors 30 high grade central osteosarcomas <NUM> low grade osteosarcomas <NUM> giant cell tumors <NUM> aneurysmatic bone cysts <NUM> osteoidosteomas osteoblastomas <NUM> fibrous dysplasias and <NUM> cases of a myositis ossificans were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the mib 1 monoclonal antibody <EOS>
<SOS> mib 1 recognizes the proliferation associated ki 67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells <EOS>
<SOS> among high grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation average value <NUM> was found in comparison with low grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors <EOS>
<SOS> this approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high grade and low grade osteosarcomas as well as bone forming intraosseous tumors <EOS>
<SOS> however distinguishing low grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible although interestingly the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans a purely reactive lesion was in the range of the values determined for high grade osteosarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee <EOS>
<SOS> among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials the central bone patellar tendon bone graft a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance <EOS>
<SOS> with some limitations allograft materials can also be used <EOS>
<SOS> each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties graft fixation and graft incorporation <EOS>
<SOS> clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others <EOS>
<SOS> when choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> for the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required <EOS>
<SOS> myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions <EOS>
<SOS> frequent causes are intercurrent infections fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis <EOS>
<SOS> early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential <EOS>
<SOS> specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids <EOS>
<SOS> infections must be treated vigorously <EOS>
<SOS> thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> whenever it can be achieved the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long term management and follow up of patients with myasthenia gravis <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective analysis we evaluated <NUM> patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea <EOS>
<SOS> the calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression <EOS>
<SOS> in subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by x ray or by intraoperative findings an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up all patients were evaluated according to the constant score <EOS>
<SOS> additionally all pre and postoperative x rays were reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> after surgery the constant score significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases where acromioplasty was performed a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved <EOS>
<SOS> the x ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders <EOS>
<SOS> there was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure <EOS>
<SOS> patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the x ray <EOS>
<SOS> an additional acromioplasty did not improve the results <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit <EOS>
<SOS> acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result <EOS>
<SOS> preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity h2ms sucralfate antacids pirenzepine and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation sucralfate pirenzepine <EOS>
<SOS> thus the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and icu regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation <EOS>
<SOS> all specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore pirenzepine has been found to be superior to h2 antagonists at least in neurosurgical patients <EOS>
<SOS> insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> the most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization <EOS>
<SOS> this may occur in long term ventilated patients with a gastric ph4 and may account for up to 50 of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients <EOS>
<SOS> mortality is not influenced by antacids or h2 antagonists while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation <EOS>
<SOS> three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy a 66 year old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion <EOS>
<SOS> computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases and recurrent blood in the stools was evident <EOS>
<SOS> the patient deteriorated rapidly and died <NUM> weeks after admission <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum grade ii with metastases to the liver <EOS>
<SOS> high grade immunoblastic non hodgkin is lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri and myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> the lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels leading to the signs of cardiac failure <EOS>
<SOS> the development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high grade immunoblastic non hodgkin is lymphoma <NUM> years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination <EOS>
<SOS> malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times <EOS>
<SOS> infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance <EOS>
<SOS> for internal control they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period <EOS>
<SOS> for inter hospital comparison they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable <EOS>
<SOS> a survey of the infection rates published during the last <NUM> years in the german traumatological literature n 71 indeed shows concerning series later than 1985 similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about <NUM> 3 after open injuries sporadically max <EOS>
<SOS> finally it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general risk of infection based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa <EOS>
<SOS> we strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection <EOS>
<SOS> the differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned <EOS>
<SOS> for all mentioned infection rates it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement <EOS>
<SOS> magnetic resonance imaging mri and computed tomography ct are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint <EOS>
<SOS> before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed mri is preferred <EOS>
<SOS> for the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on mri and ct are equivalent <EOS>
<SOS> however in older children mri may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> ct in older patients may also be useful for <NUM> analysis of bony structures e g for planning complex osteotomies <EOS>
<SOS> careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures <EOS>
<SOS> this is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non unions of these carpal bones <EOS>
<SOS> conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options <EOS>
<SOS> out of the patients who underwent surgery from january <NUM> to february <NUM> <NUM> patients with a scaphoid fracture and <NUM> patients with a scaphoid non union were in addition to standard x ray examination examined clinically and by mri pre and post operatively <EOS>
<SOS> fractures of the scaphoid were treated by herbert screw fixtion <EOS>
<SOS> when there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged dna analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient <EOS>
<SOS> the use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded dna in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples <EOS>
<SOS> a review of <NUM> children with burkitt is lymphoma admitted to the university of nigeria teaching hospital enugu during a 7 year period revealed a preponderance of males over females 1 9 <NUM> 1 and a peak incidence at five years <EOS>
<SOS> the main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen <EOS>
<SOS> the spinal column spleen and lungs were less affected <EOS>
<SOS> it is postulated that an interaction between malarial and epstein barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour <EOS>
<SOS> the most effective drug is cyclophosphamide <EOS>
<SOS> a combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse <EOS>
<SOS> follow up of the patients revealed good survival <EOS>
<SOS> the consumption of the jet set drug ecstasy 3 4 methylenedioxymetamphetamine abbreviated to mdma by young people is increasing markedly <EOS>
<SOS> parallel to this developement there is a large number of reports on severe neurological psychiatric and medical complications following the use of ecstasy <EOS>
<SOS> seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the cns following the ingestion of ecstasy <EOS>
<SOS> the term mild cognitive impairment refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of <NUM> healthy 60 64 year old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging ilse <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined <EOS>
<SOS> the following prevalence rates were determined 13 5 for age associated memory impairment 6 5 for age consistent memory impairment 1 5 for late life forgetfulness and 23 5 for aging associated cognitive decline <EOS>
<SOS> subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests <EOS>
<SOS> significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales <EOS>
<SOS> significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status <EOS>
<SOS> longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective study we evaluated <NUM> patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion <EOS>
<SOS> group i included <NUM> patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach <EOS>
<SOS> group ii included <NUM> patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach <EOS>
<SOS> group ii showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis l5 s1 4 tear of the common iliac vein 1 postsympathectomy syndrome 4 and reversible l4 nerve root lesion 3 <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of our findings we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion l5 to s1 or l4 to s1 <EOS>
<SOS> coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis <EOS>
<SOS> coronary angioplasty ptca is performed only in bail out situations <EOS>
<SOS> the number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the psychiatric clinic of the university of bonn <NUM> patients suffering from therapy resistent major depression dsm ii r were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery containing memory and nonmemory tests <EOS>
<SOS> the test battery had been applied short time before during and after the treatment with <NUM> ect applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere <EOS>
<SOS> comparing the test performances before and 1 2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in <NUM> min delayed recall of verbal items while visual short term memory and visual constructive performance showed a significant improvement in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side <EOS>
<SOS> none of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ect treatment instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly <EOS>
<SOS> between responders to treatment 50 improvement in hamd and non responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected <EOS>
<SOS> the non responders had in nearly all of the tests some better but not significantly results despite being older than the group of responders <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we assessed the drawing abilities in <NUM> patients with probable alzheimer is disease according to nincds adrda criteria <EOS>
<SOS> drawing abilities drawing house flower clock rey osterrieth figure copying mmst figure rey osterrieth figure were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments <EOS>
<SOS> all patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18 fdg <EOS>
<SOS> drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia expressed in mmst scores r 0 78 p<MOB> with visuo spatial short term memory r 0 69 p 0 001 and writing abilities r 0 77 p<MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18 fdg r 0 39 p 0 017 <EOS>
<SOS> in the drawings of ad patients omittings and simplifications were typical whereas perseverations rarely occured <EOS>
<SOS> in severely demented patients closing in phenomenons could be de scribed too <EOS>
<SOS> a subgroup of ad patients with visuo constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified <EOS>
<SOS> since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in dresden in 1869 it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense with scientific research activity and innovation <EOS>
<SOS> the good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development <EOS>
<SOS> the traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted outpatient clinic x ray and uv ligth treatment allergology and occupational dermatology psychosomatic dermatology dermatosurgery and phlebology <EOS>
<SOS> a 12 year old girl from zaire with aids cdc p2 d1 presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection <EOS>
<SOS> she had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission <EOS>
<SOS> while molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self limiting disease in immunocompetent persons a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency <EOS>
<SOS> histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of langerhans and t cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection <EOS>
<SOS> molluscum like lesions of cryptococci have been described and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> further differential diagnoses should include american and african histoplasmosis and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections of toxoplasmosis and of pneumocystis carinii infection <EOS>
<SOS> the search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours <EOS>
<SOS> characteristic vascular patterns in some cases highly tumour specific have been defined <EOS>
<SOS> the vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> we propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques <EOS>
<SOS> introduction the treatment of full thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily <EOS>
<SOS> current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation oct and autologous chondrocyte transplantation act <EOS>
<SOS> methods with a prospective clinical investigation at the time being with 2 year results we have examined act in comparison to oct in <NUM> patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological histology immunohistochemistry res outcome <EOS>
<SOS> results we found equally good results with both methods in lysholm meyers and tegner activity scores <EOS>
<SOS> histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after act showed a defect filling in all cases mainly with fibrous cartilage while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base we did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after oct <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion at the time we prefer oct instead of act given the correct indication <EOS>
<SOS> this case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic tias as cause of repetitive involuntary movements rims as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures <EOS>
<SOS> we report two patients with episodic unilateral limb shaking lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by orthostasis heat or physical exertion <EOS>
<SOS> repeated eeg recordings revealed no epileptic discharges <EOS>
<SOS> in both patients duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery ica contralateral to the side of the rims <EOS>
<SOS> blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ica occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent <EOS>
<SOS> after elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest that in patients with episodes of rims doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> ethylene dichloride edc is used as a solvent and in the rubber plastic and insecticide industry <EOS>
<SOS> the fatal adult dose is below <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> poisoning can occur from inhalation ingestion or skin absorption <EOS>
<SOS> edc depresses almost all cells but essentially those of the central nervous system liver kidneys and heart <EOS>
<SOS> death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure <EOS>
<SOS> retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors gist treated over a period of <NUM> year in the surgical department of our regional hospital we tried to answer the following questions using the current recommendations in the literature how are the macro and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted <EOS>
<SOS> which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw giving special consideration to practice orientated management of such cases <EOS>
<SOS> the patients were 65 <NUM> and <NUM> years old respectively and in each case the gist manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> during surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between <NUM> and <NUM> cm were found <EOS>
<SOS> the gist diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations <EOS>
<SOS> going through the current literature a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow up recomendations are almost unavailable <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that gists are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain <EOS>
<SOS> the potential malignancy on the other hand requires a well founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre therapeutic staging <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow up should be adapted to the risk involved <EOS>
<SOS> the latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required <EOS>
<SOS> in animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs <EOS>
<SOS> according to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today it could potentially be applied in infants in the future too <EOS>
<SOS> however the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase ii studies to be conducted <EOS>
<SOS> further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support however further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified <EOS>
<SOS> the role of elective lymph node dissection elnd in primary malignant melanoma is controversial <EOS>
<SOS> our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of elnd regarding survival and disease free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities <EOS>
<SOS> by matched pair analysis <NUM> patients treated by wide local excision wle plus elnd were compared to <NUM> patients treated by wle only <EOS>
<SOS> there was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups however the disease free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by wle plus elnd p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of <MOB> mm for the wle elnd group although the difference was not significant p 0 14 and disease free survival was significantly improved in this group p0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> elnd elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> our results confirm the findings of several studies that elnd improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness <EOS>
<SOS> 7 patients 5 female <NUM> male age <NUM> 22 81 years average age 58 1 j with recurrent necrotizing anca negative non leucocytoclastic vasculitis were enrolled into this study <EOS>
<SOS> disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin ivig dose 1 0 g kg body weight daily dose 0 25 g kg body weight over <NUM> consecutive days <EOS>
<SOS> all patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen <EOS>
<SOS> specifically immediate pain relief was striking <EOS>
<SOS> complete clearance of disease was observed in <NUM> out of <NUM> patients within <NUM> months while receiving ivig 0 5 g kg body weight every <NUM> weeks for one year <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> out of <NUM> patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> in one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function <EOS>
<SOS> the data presented demonstrate that ivig is an <NUM> effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy <EOS>
<SOS> however consideration of costs effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime <EOS>
<SOS> after orthopedic surgery skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics <EOS>
<SOS> after use of a tourniquet during surgery the muscle suffers ischemia reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress resulting in structural impairment <EOS>
<SOS> the resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance <EOS>
<SOS> degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized <EOS>
<SOS> after remobilization the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern <EOS>
<SOS> high mechanical loading should therefore be avoided and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery <EOS>
<SOS> considering the role of oxygen radicals supplementation with vitamin e appears generally recommendable <EOS>
<SOS> the timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy especially if combined with chemotherapy has been a subject of interest over the past years <EOS>
<SOS> this analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications <EOS>
<SOS> data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer lung carcinoma and head and neck carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> the reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control <EOS>
<SOS> however evaluation of the data was difficult because in most publications retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with head and neck carcinomas there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist i e close surgical margins unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy there are inconsistent reports in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> if additional chemotherapy is necessary the sequence surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate <EOS>
<SOS> although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences there may on the other hand be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> concerning lung cancer only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than <NUM> days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the german health care system <EOS>
<SOS> a total of 32 500 polytraumatized patients pts ii and iv are managed in trauma center levels i iv in germany <EOS>
<SOS> trauma center levels i or ii are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured <EOS>
<SOS> with the baseline calculation of 64 00 dm per patient and <NUM> polytrauma treated per year in the berlin virchow clinic <NUM> million dm primary costs must be spent for treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the total annual costs of this center are nearly <NUM> million dm for emergency cases and <NUM> million dm fixed costs per year for a trauma center level i <EOS>
<SOS> in europe the distribution of trauma center levels i or ii is sufficient and can be specified with <NUM> center per <NUM> million inhabitants <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions <EOS>
<SOS> this was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers <EOS>
<SOS> less then half of these patients are treated in levels i or ii trauma centers <EOS>
<SOS> the financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers <EOS>
<SOS> to meet this goal a annual treatment rate of <MOB> polytrauma patients should be aimed at <EOS>
<SOS> the claim of the american college of surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat <NUM> severely injured patients per year would then be possible <EOS>
<SOS> this report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved <EOS>
<SOS> in the spring of <NUM> a total of <NUM> bioenergetic therapists 6 of them medical doctors and <NUM> psychologists all members of the swiss society of bioenergetic therapists sgbat provided upon request a number of data on <NUM> patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of <NUM> sessions <NUM> months to <NUM> years earlier <EOS>
<SOS> a self evaluating questionnaire was then constructed to be answered anonymously and was sent to these <NUM> patients in late summer 1997 <NUM> of them could be reached and <NUM> 49 returned it <EOS>
<SOS> the questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned <EOS>
<SOS> bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the stability of the therapeutic result <NUM> patients indicated a stable or even improved condition <EOS>
<SOS> of the <NUM> patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy <NUM> opted again for a body oriented psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> purpose in a clinical study <NUM> patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using ct angiography mr angiography mra and digital subtraction angiography dsa <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms <EOS>
<SOS> classic choroidal neovascularization cnv has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast indocyanine green icg angiography shows variable features of well defined cnv <EOS>
<SOS> we examined <NUM> classic cnv patients secondary to age related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope heidelberg retina angiograph in order to determine icg characteristics of classic cnv <EOS>
<SOS> vascular patterns 97 a hypofluorescent rim 84 a hyperfluorescent margin 42 late icg leakage 32 and feeder vessels were identified in variable frequency <EOS>
<SOS> some of the icg characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity <EOS>
<SOS> extrafoveal feeder vessels may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal cnv <EOS>
<SOS> in situ polymerase chain reaction pcr and pcr in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology <EOS>
<SOS> these techniques can combine the sensitivity of pcr with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures <EOS>
<SOS> with optical control of the pcr reaction product in these techniques false positive results due to contamination can be minimized <EOS>
<SOS> several working protocols have been established which allow detection of dna and rna sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner <EOS>
<SOS> two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product the indirect pcr in situ hybridization pcrishyb and the direct in situ pcr is pcr <EOS>
<SOS> an easy and reproducible method for pcrishyb and ispcr in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared <EOS>
<SOS> using both ispcr and pcrishyb the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue <EOS>
<SOS> indirect pcrishyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct ispcr was the quicker easier and less expensive method <EOS>

<SOS> this report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury <EOS>
<SOS> subsequent to trauma there was segmental multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory intenseful painful symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> none of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present <EOS>
<SOS> normal therapy resulted in more severe symptoms <EOS>

<SOS> only after 5xed95 cisatracurium was <NUM> elevated histamine level documented after <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> in several studies increased histamine levels have been described but without clinical manifestations <EOS>
<SOS> it is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells <EOS>
<SOS> the cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone <EOS>
<SOS> the tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release <EOS>
<SOS> no relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed <EOS>

<SOS> this report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt pa it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention <EOS>
<SOS> after femorofemoral coupling on the heart lung machine right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained <EOS>
<SOS> during the course of a 3 hour period of extracorporal circulation the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels <EOS>

<SOS> as a consequence of this development and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy <EOS>
<SOS> this procedure allowed on the one hand the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart lung machine <EOS>
<SOS> on the other due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized <EOS>

<SOS> invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about <NUM> years old <EOS>
<SOS> this article surveying this period written by an r d engineer deals with four parts first the situation before <NUM> is touched upon <EOS>
<SOS> for the time after <NUM> the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of prof dr k bachmann and to the facility which in <NUM> was designed together with him and further developed <EOS>
<SOS> k bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965 which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self evident use today <EOS>
<SOS> the first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in <NUM> appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility <EOS>
<SOS> the fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and considering the new methods using mri ebct as well as ct it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium term future <EOS>
<SOS> proton pump inhibitors omeprazole lansoprazole and pantoprazole have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> these substances inhibit the h k atpase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of h2 receptor antagonists <EOS>
<SOS> the first proton pump inhibitor omeprazole has been introduced ten years ago <EOS>
<SOS> since then sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated <EOS>
<SOS> omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older <EOS>
<SOS> a new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients <EOS>
<SOS> the main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies <EOS>
<SOS> in the treatment of helicobacter pylori infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics <EOS>
<SOS> the recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0 7 1 4 mg kg bodyweight and day <EOS>
<SOS> however some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to <NUM> mg kg <EOS>
<SOS> healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy <EOS>

<SOS> nosocomial urinary tract infections uti are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the resection itself postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections <EOS>
<SOS> in this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications <EOS>

<SOS> on the other hand we only found corresponding prostate and postoperative urine cultures in less than 50 <EOS>
<SOS> the presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative uti is in transurethral prostatectomy <EOS>
<SOS> under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial uti is in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general <EOS>
<SOS> apnea bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care <EOS>
<SOS> the prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment however are controversial <EOS>
<SOS> the universal aim in order to prevent traumatization of the lung is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible <EOS>
<SOS> therefore drugs such as theophylline aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal cpap have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> in these studies we developed a treatment algorithm <EOS>
<SOS> in two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline <EOS>
<SOS> as aminophylline has more side effects sodium acetate theophylline is preferable <EOS>
<SOS> bradycardia apnea and desaturation were registered from the print out of the monitoring system is trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady state conditions <EOS>
<SOS> in a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration <EOS>
<SOS> we demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline however doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first <NUM> days of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal cpap as the third level of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of bradycardia apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during cpap and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved <EOS>
<SOS> the algorithm developed established theophylline with <NUM> mg kg as bolus infusion over <NUM> min followed by <NUM> mg kg bid as the first line of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice indication 4 bradycardias below 80 min <NUM> desaturations below 80 or <NUM> apneas of 20 s over <NUM> h <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe 3 apneas <NUM> bradycardias or <NUM> desaturations over this period <EOS>
<SOS> nasal cpap was introduced as the third line of treatment <EOS>
<SOS> with this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from <NUM> to <NUM> days p0 01 <EOS>
<SOS> an evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi institutional studies is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> background associations between back pain the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically <EOS>
<SOS> methods at check out we asked <NUM> consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night <EOS>
<SOS> nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests <EOS>
<SOS> sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between <NUM> very good and <NUM> very bad and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8 year old mattresses of the hotel but also with respect to social e g <EOS>
<SOS> private vs professional reason for the stay as well as personal e g <EOS>
<SOS> previous experience with low back and sleep complaints characteristics of the guests <EOS>
<SOS> results the three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep but the difference to the old mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion at least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant <EOS>
<SOS> body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in patient and out patient settings individually or in groups alone or combined with other methods <EOS>
<SOS> these methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced who are restricted in their emotions or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character <EOS>
<SOS> short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays reference is made to other procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors <EOS>
<SOS> in later development the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too which is important for the therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed <EOS>
<SOS> approaches to empirical research are pointed out <EOS>
<SOS> paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer <EOS>
<SOS> supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected <EOS>
<SOS> the current possibilities for treatment are limited <EOS>
<SOS> a female patient aged 57 suffering from a breast cancer developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks <EOS>
<SOS> it is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing <NUM> months was not due to therapy <EOS>
<SOS> although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself <EOS>
<SOS> a recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred <NUM> months later but again showed a good remission <EOS>
<SOS> the outcome in <NUM> patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution <NUM> years ago is investigated <EOS>
<SOS> some <NUM> patients underwent operative aneurysm repair <NUM> 13 were excluded from operation <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> 66 an elective procedure was performed an emergency operation for rupture <NUM> times 21 <EOS>
<SOS> in 16 of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted <EOS>
<SOS> for further analysis the patients were split in three groups elective group 1 symptomatic group 2 ruptured group <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter distribution of gender 128 m <NUM> f renal artery involvement or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking hyperlipidemia renal insufficiency and the presence of multiple risk factors <EOS>
<SOS> group <NUM> had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2 whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group <NUM> than in the other two groups <EOS>
<SOS> sixty four percent of patients had no 11 had more than one complication <EOS>
<SOS> mortality was <NUM> in groups <NUM> and 2 but 35 3 in group <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent complication in groups <NUM> and <NUM> was pneumonia 13 9 followed by cardiac complications 4 6 and renal insufficiency 3 7 <EOS>
<SOS> in group <NUM> respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence 23 5 followed by renal insufficiency 21 and pneumonia 17 6 <EOS>
<SOS> no patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture aneurysm diameters except one did not increase during the follow up period <EOS>
<SOS> of the <NUM> operated and discharged patients <NUM> died in no case was death related to the operative procedure <EOS>
<SOS> no important complications were observed during the follow up of <NUM> <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the results are compared with those of the literature <EOS>
<SOS> based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 32 year old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract <EOS>
<SOS> treatment with fluconazole <NUM> mg day was introduced <EOS>
<SOS> after oral intake of fluconazole over <NUM> months itraconazole <NUM> mg day was given for <NUM> month <EOS>
<SOS> however fungal infection still persisted <EOS>
<SOS> the antifungal activity of fluconazole itraconazole and ketoconazole against candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90 inhibitory concentrations of each drugs <EOS>
<SOS> a high minimal inhibitory concentration mic was detected for fluconazole 50 µg ml revealing fluconazole resistance <EOS>
<SOS> the susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline mic <NUM> µg ml and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered mic <NUM> µg ml <EOS>
<SOS> plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered <EOS>
<SOS> in hiv patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the clinical resistance of candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in hiv patients <EOS>
<SOS> patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance <EOS>
<SOS> besides this recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels <EOS>
<SOS> mri and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> vessel invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone <EOS>
<SOS> if there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft <EOS>
<SOS> soft tissue coverage is of major importance particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue <EOS>
<SOS> after radical resection and combined modality therapy one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion <EOS>
<SOS> to achieve this goal surgical oncologists vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together <EOS>
<SOS> today amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel invasive soft tissue tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high frequency jet ventilation shfjv is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency <EOS>

<SOS> for many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient <EOS>
<SOS> while severity scores deal with the 1st icu day physiology the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the icu stay <EOS>
<SOS> most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts giving to each dysfunction a number of points usually <NUM> to 4 according to the severity <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> systems are different the mods of marshall et al <EOS>
<SOS> and the logistic organ dysfunction lod system of le gall et al both published recently 1995 and 1996 <EOS>
<SOS> they differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review mdos or from a logistic regression lod and secondly because neither takes into account the therapy <EOS>
<SOS> besides the lod system when used on the 1st icu day has statistical qualities which are very promising <EOS>
<SOS> the lod system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an european multicenter study <EOS>
<SOS> the relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen bcl 2 could be shown in epithelial tumors <EOS>
<SOS> a bcl 2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis <EOS>
<SOS> the potential meaning of bcl 2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> the fact that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present suggested to investigate the bcl 2 expression in osteosarcoma <EOS>
<SOS> thus immunohistochemistry was used to analyze <NUM> specimens of different osteosarcomas of <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> sixteen cases 46 showed a strong expression of bcl 2 and <NUM> cases 35 were moderately positiv for bcl 2 <EOS>
<SOS> seven cases 19 were negative for bcl 2 <EOS>
<SOS> the heterogenous negative up to strong expression of bcl 2 yield clues that the bcl 2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics <EOS>
<SOS> additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody mib 1 directed against the ki 67 epitop <EOS>
<SOS> the data of bcl 2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification <EOS>
<SOS> to verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether bcl 2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma further investigations will be needed <EOS>

<SOS> they had an extremely itching elevated exanthema mainly on their legs <EOS>
<SOS> the single efflorescence had a diameter of about 1 3 cm <EOS>
<SOS> there were no signs of infection or fever <EOS>
<SOS> intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare <EOS>
<SOS> clinical symptoms are nonspecific in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration <EOS>
<SOS> with the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the caecum a neoplasm is often considered <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described <EOS>
<SOS> thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> there are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are washed into a circle containing dried soda lime <EOS>

<SOS> surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area dating back to the early nineteenth century <EOS>
<SOS> more than <NUM> years ago hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons <EOS>
<SOS> the block principle we are now following dates back to crile who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection <EOS>
<SOS> ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients <EOS>
<SOS> the development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps <EOS>
<SOS> the change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer <EOS>
<SOS> free bone grafting inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites <EOS>
<SOS> although the five year survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past <NUM> years distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded <EOS>
<SOS> this is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the dösak has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors especially from an aesthetic point of view <EOS>
<SOS> tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular transmaxillar or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> concerning the concept of neck dissection radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure <EOS>
<SOS> actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in no neck or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification <EOS>
<SOS> laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> due to its physical properties the co2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the high absorption of its wavelength in water 10600 nm is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue <EOS>
<SOS> shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects such as carbonization and coagulation <EOS>
<SOS> this effect can be lessened with the silktouch scanner since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors <EOS>
<SOS> this enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions <EOS>
<SOS> particularly well suited for treatment hypertrophic scars post acne scarring perioral and periorbital wrinkles rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris <EOS>
<SOS> cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment <EOS>
<SOS> periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the co2 laser and the silktouch scanner <EOS>
<SOS> acute spinal cord injury affects more than <NUM> individuals per year with predominantly young people between <NUM> and <NUM> years of age being involved <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care <EOS>
<SOS> therefore there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed <EOS>
<SOS> the first hours after the accident are decisive because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later <EOS>
<SOS> besides the fate of the individual patient the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care long lasting rehabilitation as well as post rehabilitative care <EOS>
<SOS> chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons expecially in hippocampus by which the degree of damage differs in various species <EOS>
<SOS> sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration disturbed feed back reaction and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors gr in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups 5 6 and 17 24 months respectively is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors modulators participate in this process <EOS>
<SOS> introduction the treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods the data of <NUM> patients who were treated between <NUM> and 1998 were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> 48 were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> results fifty nine procedures were used including skin transplantation in <NUM> patients local flaps in <NUM> cases regional flaps in <NUM> cases and microvascular procedures in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> amputation was required in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> the overall success rate was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> complications occurred in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area <EOS>
<SOS> the modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> the conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> recording of the eeg would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient <EOS>

<SOS> apc resistance was first discovered in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> it is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in europe and north america <EOS>
<SOS> in more than 90 of cases the underlying cause of apc resistance is a single point mutation in the factor v gene <EOS>
<SOS> heterozygous patients have a between five and ten fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50 and 100 fold <EOS>
<SOS> where there is a previous history of thrombosis a careful investigation of the coagulation system in particular a determination of the apc ratio is recommended prior to surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with apc resistance a body weight specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time <EOS>
<SOS> primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications <EOS>
<SOS> pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to staphylococcus aureus <EOS>
<SOS> the disease is found more often in males <EOS>
<SOS> since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore cases of pyomyositis are rare in non tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it <EOS>
<SOS> if not diagnosed and treated properly pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death <EOS>
<SOS> although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known trivial trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles small potentially septic foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency e g in diabetes mellitus intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from hiv <EOS>
<SOS> three cases of non tropical pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors taking forensic aspects histomorphologic findings and the problems of post mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> aim of the study the etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated <EOS>

<SOS> aims evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane bm formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3d co culture system collagen type i fibroblast containing matrix <EOS>
<SOS> material and methods oscc cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type i matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of invasion was done by conventional h e staining after paraffin embedding immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins mnf 116 involucrin sy5 vimentin v9 collagen type iv civ22 laminin 1 chain 4c7 and ki 67 mib1 and electron microscopy followed <EOS>
<SOS> results the oscc cell lines pe ca pj15 pe ca pj34 pe ca pj41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd oscc cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin <EOS>
<SOS> there was no evidence for bm either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy although oscc are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type iv and laminin in the 2d cell culture <EOS>
<SOS> there were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion <EOS>
<SOS> the absence of a bm does not per se imply an invasive tumour growth <EOS>
<SOS> moreover stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural bm <EOS>
<SOS> interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing <EOS>
<SOS> limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability <EOS>
<SOS> although larger movements still promote callus formation the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered <EOS>
<SOS> fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large <EOS>
<SOS> a combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non union <EOS>
<SOS> therefore having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis <EOS>
<SOS> dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process <EOS>
<SOS> external mechanical stimulation however has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load bearing patients <EOS>
<SOS> although ketamine has been in clinical use for <NUM> decades the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic anaesthetic sympathomimetic and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years however new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology <EOS>
<SOS> this article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand operated and voltage operated transmembrane ion channels g protein coupled receptors transmitter uptake and the no cgmp system in neurons <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception analgesia anaesthesia and psychotomimesis the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors there is now considerable evidence that nmda antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic analgesic anaesthetic and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine <EOS>
<SOS> moreover the involvement of non nmda glutamate receptors muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission interactions with 5 ht receptors and l type ca2 channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties <EOS>
<SOS> there is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ent specialists <EOS>
<SOS> so far a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in the ent departments of the hospitals of mannheim kaiserslautern and tübingen studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between february <NUM> and may <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol ethanol 80 and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures <EOS>
<SOS> as discussed in the article disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels <EOS>
<SOS> white piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals caused by the widespread trichosporon fungi <EOS>
<SOS> the infection is characterized clinically by whitish soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts however the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points <EOS>
<SOS> while all body hair may be affected the pubic hair is most frequently affected <EOS>
<SOS> this paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34 year old central european man <EOS>
<SOS> in all <NUM> cases have been described world wide in young men ranging in age from <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> only <NUM> men aged <NUM> and <NUM> years do not fall in this range <EOS>
<SOS> recently a major african study disclosed this disease in women for the first time <EOS>
<SOS> in moderate latitudes however this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men <EOS>
<SOS> in open fractures the rate of infected non union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques <EOS>
<SOS> in the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied <EOS>
<SOS> this includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue provides mechanical stability in the non union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic target specific and temporary well defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation <EOS>
<SOS> the incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material <EOS>
<SOS> a promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction therefore special attention is given to ilizarov is ring fixation system <EOS>
<SOS> unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer which seems to be superior to other methods <EOS>

<SOS> many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so called diabetic foot syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> among chronic complications the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization <EOS>
<SOS> the relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to <NUM> times greater than in normal subjects <EOS>
<SOS> sensory neuropathy ischemia and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer <EOS>
<SOS> in this article an overview of the different causes clinical manifestations and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> lung resection offers the best prospect of long term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function <EOS>
<SOS> accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid a refusal of potentially curative treatment and b severe postoperative disability <EOS>
<SOS> the origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial <EOS>
<SOS> thus no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications <EOS>
<SOS> criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value so that patient is age sex and height will be taken into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously <EOS>
<SOS> the high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake vo2max in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established <EOS>
<SOS> the calculation of predicted postoperative lung function ppo is of importance <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 ppo the transfer factor tl co ppo and vo2max ppo can be predicted by using the same formula <EOS>
<SOS> patients with nearly normal lung function fev1 tl co <NUM> predicted and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> in the others fev1 ppo and tl co ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected <EOS>
<SOS> patients with values <NUM> predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable whereas values <NUM> predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics <EOS>
<SOS> vo2max <NUM> ml kg min or <NUM> predicted are prohibitive for surgery <EOS>
<SOS> if vo2max is <NUM> ml kg min or <NUM> predicted functional operability without limitation is given <EOS>
<SOS> for those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains fev1 ppo tl co ppo and vo2max ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans <EOS>
<SOS> patients with either fev1 ppo and tl co ppo <NUM> predicted or vo2max ppo <NUM> ml kg min or <NUM> predicted are deemed inoperable <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of acute of achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years <EOS>
<SOS> decisive for this development was the application of mri and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons <EOS>
<SOS> the question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively <EOS>
<SOS> these advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols <EOS>
<SOS> the decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospective randomized study <MOB> at the trauma dept <EOS>
<SOS> of the hannover medical school could show no statistical differences comparing functional non operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot variostabil adidas <EOS>
<SOS> the crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion 20 <NUM> ° <EOS>
<SOS> with complete adaptation of the tendons ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome <EOS>
<SOS> regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages <EOS>
<SOS> both the operative and non operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture 1 2 <EOS>
<SOS> meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated achilles tendons <EOS>
<SOS> there seems to be a trend towards non operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings or to minimal invasive surgical techniques <EOS>
<SOS> based on a case report we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with sleep apnea syndrome sas who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old male patient with a body mass index of 34 22 kg m2 and receiving continuous positive airway pressure cpap therapy for known sas was scheduled for elective plastic surgery <EOS>
<SOS> after induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia <EOS>
<SOS> with the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening <EOS>
<SOS> the following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction confirmed the difficult anatomical structures <EOS>
<SOS> the subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful <EOS>
<SOS> the patient received cpap therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit <EOS>
<SOS> he made an uneventful recovery <EOS>
<SOS> he was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation where possible in the case of further anesthetic intervention <EOS>
<SOS> sas has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors obesity male sex history of intense snoring impaired daytime performance nonrefreshing daytime naps are presented for surgery this condition should be considered <EOS>
<SOS> elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary <EOS>
<SOS> patients with sas should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale <EOS>
<SOS> it is most important to avoid sedative premedication to initiate cpap therapy preoperatively to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period <EOS>
<SOS> planned fiberoptic intubation preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively patients are at high risk from respiratory depression even in the awake state <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative opioid analgesia no matter what route should only be given under close monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost rem sleep due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days <EOS>
<SOS> life style measures weight reduction and control reduction of total fat calories to 30 of total calories modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat increased intake of dietary fibers increased physical activity controlled stress relaxation are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease <EOS>

<SOS> in the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> within <NUM> years <NUM> patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative apache ii score of <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> thirty six patients were found to have infected necrosis while <NUM> patients had sterile necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre and postoperative parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with penrose drains <EOS>
<SOS> this technique produced the lowest reported mortality of <NUM> with a reoperation rate of only <NUM> demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction mi is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes <EOS>

<SOS> in a prospective clinical study of <NUM> patients undergoing tur p under spinal anaesthesia expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid 2 ethanol in purisole fresenius bad homburg were monitored <EOS>
<SOS> gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor normac datex helsinki that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use <EOS>
<SOS> in addition at intervals of <NUM> minutes we measured blood alcohol endtidal alcohol alcotest 7110 drauml ger lübeck haematocrit serum na concentration and blood gases <EOS>
<SOS> sixty eight measurements were obtained from the <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> as shown in other studies serum na r2 0 68 and hct r2 0 39 correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest <NUM> r2 0 93 and normac devices r2 0 85 were closely related <EOS>
<SOS> continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during tur p <EOS>

<SOS> of the <NUM> patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament <NUM> were anatomically reduced <EOS>
<SOS> except in one patient functional results were excellent kt100 was <NUM> mm average loss of flexion was <NUM> ° loss of extension was <NUM> ° <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle reduction was anatomical <EOS>
<SOS> the fractures healed the patients were free of pain and had full rom at the follow up <EOS>
<SOS> the fracture of the patella healed in <NUM> weeks with full rom of the knee <EOS>
<SOS> there was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra articular fractures of the knee <EOS>
<SOS> provided indications are good results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy <EOS>
<SOS> there is less postoperative morbidity and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter <EOS>
<SOS> some technical hints are presented <EOS>
<SOS> a healthy 38 year old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest <NUM> days after a vaginal hysterectomy <EOS>
<SOS> although standard cardiac life support cpr was instituted immediately after the event it was not possible to re establish a spontaneous circulation for about <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of <NUM> million iu urokinase was performed as a final life maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus <NUM> min later after <NUM> min of ongoing cpr the patient regained a stable circulation <EOS>
<SOS> she survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of cpr <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between <NUM> and <NUM> we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging <EOS>
<SOS> the same histopathological work up was carried out in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> whether resections or extirpations were performed the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from <NUM> and 1985 1986 to <NUM> and <NUM> 1991 1992 and to <NUM> and <NUM> 1993 1994 respectively <EOS>
<SOS> neither the type of operation nor the surgeon is experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk <EOS>
<SOS> we found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases p 0 02 and between an increase in uicc stage ii p 0 005 and pn2 tumors p 0 00 and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected <EOS>
<SOS> central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases <EOS>
<SOS> with the institution of the protection against infection act case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in germany for the first time <EOS>
<SOS> case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities <EOS>
<SOS> the case definitions which were developed by the robert koch institute rki according to the protection against infection act enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the rki via the state health <URL> quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved as each reported case infection will fulfil defined criteria thereby enabling unclear cases diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts by guided bone regeneration by distraction osteogenesis by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion <EOS>
<SOS> those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary if <NUM> complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant supported devices <EOS>
<SOS> a 58 year old woman was initially externally diagnosed in <NUM> with a presacral mass which was subsequently treated as an abcess <EOS>
<SOS> thereafter the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas <EOS>
<SOS> further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor considered to be an epidermoid cyst which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed <EOS>
<SOS> histologically cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> later on the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass <EOS>
<SOS> as a result an abdominal perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done <EOS>
<SOS> histologically adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail gut cyst <EOS>
<SOS> one year following her operation the patient is free from any complaints and relapses <EOS>
<SOS> the tail gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail gut during embryonal development <EOS>
<SOS> a malignant transformation occurs in <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum a tail gut cyst should be taken into consideration the goal being its complete removal <EOS>
<SOS> the german social law has required quality assurance qa procedures since <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the measures must be suitable to allow comparing investigations <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> the german society of anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine published recommendations for qa in anaesthesia most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner and thus a list of <NUM> pitfalls events and complications pecs and five degrees of severity were defined <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of this study was to determine the frequency of pecs in anaesthesia and to correlate pecs with procedures and preoperative health status <EOS>
<SOS> using the diary method the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood <EOS>
<SOS> duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the data were analyzed interindividually using regression analyses and intraindividually using time series analyses <EOS>
<SOS> while positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter and intraindividual perspective there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective <EOS>
<SOS> theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> purpose regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced deep seated tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non invasive three dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the transfusion law which came into force on <NUM> july 1998 is to ensure the supply with safe blood products to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma <EOS>
<SOS> in order to reach this goal the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents as well for safe usage of blood products <EOS>
<SOS> moreover it lays down rules for look back procedures prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations creates a legal basis for the advisory group arbeitskreis blut and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions <EOS>
<SOS> in the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries <EOS>
<SOS> disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs <EOS>
<SOS> accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations <EOS>
<SOS> a review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of <NUM> for current pain <EOS>
<SOS> 7 to <NUM> are frequently often daily or constantly affected <EOS>
<SOS> 75 of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year <EOS>
<SOS> 80 to <NUM> of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever <EOS>
<SOS> gender specific differences are only present in severe chronic forms which are more often experienced by women <EOS>
<SOS> back pain has a prevalence maximum at <NUM> to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> older persons display lower prevalence estimates <EOS>
<SOS> the prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women <EOS>
<SOS> there are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article <EOS>
<SOS> back pain can be classified by location temporal characteristics pain intensity and pain history <EOS>
<SOS> currently for none of these dimensions generally accepted uniformly employed and validated definitions are available <EOS>
<SOS> in most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> 75 90 of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5 10 of patients who are disabled <EOS>
<SOS> as predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors <EOS>
<SOS> for a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable <EOS>
<SOS> if the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable <EOS>
<SOS> after six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work <EOS>
<SOS> rarely back pain is present as a single symptom <EOS>
<SOS> in more than <NUM> back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint <EOS>
<SOS> it remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies <EOS>
<SOS> dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain <EOS>
<SOS> consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine friendly behaviour <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to various measures of pain therapy physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro physiotherapy physical treatment eg electrotherapy balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training medical rehabilitation therapy mrt ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain <EOS>
<SOS> mrt applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> various objectives of mrt are outlined with special regard to the stages of mrt treatment emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro muscular system in the course of rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> physicians are responsible for mrt diagnosis and control <EOS>
<SOS> taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine mrt objectives and treatment strategies <EOS>
<SOS> a 39 year old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid asa <EOS>
<SOS> skin tests and cap specific <EOS>
<SOS> ige demonstrated an ige mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds <EOS>
<SOS> when sunflower seeds were eaten alone only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred <EOS>
<SOS> surprisingly an oral challenge with asa was well tolerated <EOS>
<SOS> the supplementary centribution of asa to the allergic reaction was done dependent <EOS>
<SOS> the quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> this surprising effect of asa may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens <EOS>
<SOS> during the course of this reaction eosinophil cationic protein was released <EOS>
<SOS> axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically <EOS>
<SOS> periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability <EOS>
<SOS> various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures <EOS>
<SOS> we treated <NUM> patients with <NUM> periprosthetic fractures between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> of these <NUM> 78 fractures were treated with a plate eight 14 with a revision prosthesis two 4 with retrograde nailing and two 4 conservatively due to poor medical condition <EOS>
<SOS> the choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> fractures healed primarily <EOS>
<SOS> complications included three cases of plate loosening one further fracture one deep infection one broken bolt and one varus deformity <EOS>
<SOS> four patients died in the postoperative period an additional <NUM> were dead at the time of the evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation <EOS>
<SOS> cases of a loose implant require revision <EOS>
<SOS> distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail <EOS>
<SOS> a young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open blasting of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorty by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported <EOS>
<SOS> in the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties <EOS>
<SOS> the particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report <EOS>
<SOS> the situation of oncological surgery in germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in january <NUM> to <NUM> registered surgical clinics <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> responded and stated that they are involved in that field <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10 30 of their overall work <EOS>
<SOS> the proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics <EOS>
<SOS> colorectal surgery is <NUM> and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery <EOS>
<SOS> 73 of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high 45 <EOS>
<SOS> many hospitals 54 6 report neoadjuvant treatment regimens <EOS>
<SOS> together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> however the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used <EOS>
<SOS> a second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic but not between centers <EOS>
<SOS> the surgeon is position concerning the speciality surgical oncology is ambivalent only <NUM> of the department chiefs support this speciality and over <NUM> of the departments reject the structural independence of surgical oncology from visceral surgery <EOS>
<SOS> cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn <EOS>
<SOS> however no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available <EOS>
<SOS> a considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> actuarial 6 12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50 75 <EOS>
<SOS> since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment <EOS>
<SOS> however the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> during the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed <EOS>
<SOS> the conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers <EOS>
<SOS> alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery high risk valve surgery mechanical assist devices implantable cardioverter defibrillators partial left ventriculectomy cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing <EOS>
<SOS> they serve as bridge to transplantation or medium and long term alternatives to heart transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy <EOS>
<SOS> this requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure <EOS>
<SOS> motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash <EOS>
<SOS> in the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations <EOS>
<SOS> in the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value <EOS>
<SOS> data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine coordinative disturbances postural control tmj function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash <EOS>
<SOS> the standardisation of technical and clinical set ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost nor time consuming and free of adverse effects <EOS>
<SOS> within a prospective series of <NUM> patients 14 m <NUM> f with a follow up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy v <NUM> km h rear end collision type i with disturbances in complex movements only type ii with overall restriction of movement <EOS>
<SOS> control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> recovery from whiplash within <NUM> weeks could be monitored <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory <EOS>
<SOS> to test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients three women and seven men mean age <NUM> 3 4 with somnambulism <EOS>
<SOS> their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex and age matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation <EOS>
<SOS> patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls which was nonsignificant <EOS>
<SOS> in magnetic resonance tomography patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior <EOS>
<SOS> sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals reduced arousal index significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages nonsignificant <EOS>
<SOS> complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation whereas sleepwalking did not increase <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the american sleep disorder society <EOS>
<SOS> complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent <EOS>
<SOS> its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals <EOS>
<SOS> sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking <EOS>
<SOS> concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone <EOS>
<SOS> introduction in order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5 year recurrence and survival rates we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques <EOS>
<SOS> department a removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes department b en bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods the surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between <NUM> and <NUM> department a <NUM> colon and <NUM> rectal carcinomas department b <NUM> colon and <NUM> rectal carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> results the local recurrence rate achieved by department a was signicantly higher colon carcinoma department a <NUM> department b <NUM> rectal carcinoma department a <NUM> department b <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the 5 year survival rate for colon carcinoma was <NUM> in department a and <NUM> in department b the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being <NUM> and <NUM> respectively <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion the results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> definition of the problem ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges <EOS>
<SOS> the practice of ethics consultation as performed at the freiburg university hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination <EOS>
<SOS> the range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> a research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs from there on the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services <EOS>
<SOS> suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics consultants are formulated on the basis of both the author is and international work <EOS>
<SOS> finally the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the german speaking world are raised and the long term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health care system is highlighted <EOS>
<SOS> objectives bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients suffering from stage i and stage ii melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support <EOS>
<SOS> additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59 of the patients and interviews with a psychotherapist by 20 <EOS>
<SOS> patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist <EOS>
<SOS> patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support <EOS>
<SOS> the original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration synoviocyte proliferation neo vascularization and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins <EOS>
<SOS> adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes <EOS>
<SOS> in this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin integrin and immunglobulin families and of the cd44 molecule in the cell cell and cell matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis <EOS>
<SOS> during the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone pregnanolone for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose <EOS>
<SOS> until now however no investigations have been undertaken dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration effect relationship <EOS>
<SOS> secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects <EOS>
<SOS> background intraoperative measurements of local intracapillary hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the erlangen microlight guided spectrophotometer <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate electrophysiologically the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea <EOS>
<SOS> high dose uva1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> however some patients do not respond well to this new therapy <EOS>
<SOS> we attempted to further characterize the non responder population in a retrospective study <EOS>
<SOS> two closely matched groups of responders n 20 and non responders n 20 were compared <EOS>
<SOS> no significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters skin type minimal erythema dose single and cumulative doses of uva1 and peripheral blood eosinophils <EOS>
<SOS> however non responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score and by high levels of total ige and of specific ige <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore colonization of the skin with staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities and intestinal growth of candida albicans was more frequently observed <EOS>
<SOS> these data indicate that high dose uva1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that non responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high dose uva1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> introduction many causes are given as <NUM> the main reason for inadequate pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over austria who prescribe prescriptions <EOS>
<SOS> we report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium an anomaly not documented so far in the german literature <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms usually persistent since birth <EOS>
<SOS> it is transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode and has a benign course <EOS>
<SOS> in our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations <EOS>
<SOS> the decline of std in the region of rostock germany since <NUM> is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of chlamydia infections was about 45 in our venerological patients as common as gonorrhea used to be <EOS>
<SOS> genital candidal infections were to be found in 23 <EOS>
<SOS> mycoplasmas were identified in 15 usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis <EOS>
<SOS> the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hodgkin is disease and non hodgkin is lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades <EOS>
<SOS> clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large field technique with total nodal irradiation tni or total lymphatic irradiation tli <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk <EOS>
<SOS> today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions involved field irradiation ifi <EOS>
<SOS> the german society of oral and maxillofacial surgery was founded by martin waßmund in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> one of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention <EOS>
<SOS> the society originally composed of <NUM> members was first called the german society of maxillofacial surgery <EOS>
<SOS> in 1972 it extended its title to include the term oral mund and currently comprises <NUM> members <EOS>
<SOS> a scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic <EOS>
<SOS> the lectures given there have been published since <NUM> in fortschritte der kiefer und gesichts chirurgie progress in maxillofacial surgery by thieme verlag since 1997 they have appeared as a springer verlag supplement <EOS>
<SOS> topics of choice are published in mund kiefer und gesichtschirurgie oral and maxillofacial surgery originally by hanser in munich and now by springer verlag in heidelberg <EOS>
<SOS> in this manner it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty <EOS>
<SOS> each year since 1957 a prize named after m waßmund has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment <EOS>
<SOS> the presidents convention locations topics and prizewinners are listed in a table <EOS>
<SOS> since the founding of the society of oral and maxillofacial surgery close cooperation has existed with the national association of german oral and maxillary facial surgeons bundesverband der deutschen ärzte für mund kiefer gesichts chirurgie <EOS>
<SOS> in order to intertwine scientific and political interests a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood <EOS>
<SOS> of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume <EOS>
<SOS> nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms sympathetic nervous system renin angiotensin system vasopressin endothelin prostanoids natriuretic peptides lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction <EOS>
<SOS> supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> the mortality is still high exceeding 90 <EOS>
<SOS> renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected acute liver failure waiting for liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> year old patient with the typical clinical signs of albright is hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue <EOS>
<SOS> after termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs <EOS>
<SOS> ct scan revealed diffuse brain edema <EOS>
<SOS> electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing <EOS>
<SOS> in laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia 1 15 mmol l and hyperphosphatemia <EOS>
<SOS> blood parathyroid hormone pth was elevated <EOS>
<SOS> pth test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism <EOS>
<SOS> the patient was treated with calcium and 1 25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol <EOS>
<SOS> after few days the severe encephalopathy ct and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible <EOS>
<SOS> hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases <EOS>
<SOS> hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment <EOS>
<SOS> an adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine placental and fetal growth <EOS>
<SOS> maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus <EOS>
<SOS> thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival <EOS>
<SOS> reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both <EOS>
<SOS> chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced hyertension pih diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction iugr <EOS>
<SOS> chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus <EOS>
<SOS> if compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue <EOS>
<SOS> in view of a possible stent implantation <NUM> infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters <EOS>
<SOS> then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the following results were obtained <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck <EOS>
<SOS> up to an aneurysmal length of <NUM> cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases <EOS>
<SOS> with lengths of more than <NUM> cm according to the morphological results the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple tube stent <EOS>
<SOS> the proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> for longer aneurysms only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para aneurysmal regions <EOS>
<SOS> these findings have to be considered with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48 year old man <EOS>
<SOS> these slow growing mostly benign and encapsulated intradural extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi onally by incontinence <EOS>
<SOS> paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous main cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so called sustentacular cells some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation <EOS>
<SOS> because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron specific enolase chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides main cells and s 100 protein sustentacular cells while widely lacking reactivity for gfap <EOS>
<SOS> paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity of which only <NUM> cases have been described in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> because they only occur sporadically they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina <EOS>
<SOS> approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence the type of primary therapy administered and the patient is general condition <EOS>
<SOS> the limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available surgical operation radiotherapy chemotherapy are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies <EOS>
<SOS> in general empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned <EOS>
<SOS> the main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> post traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease <EOS>
<SOS> we present the case of a 38 year old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma <EOS>

<SOS> the dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his her facility admission diagnosis treatment transfer and discharge of patients <EOS>
<SOS> however in developing such general hospital information systems one runs into the following problems 1 medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment 2 the structure of medical information is extremely complex except for certain limited administrative data admission transfer and discharge for example needed by the clinic administration <EOS>
<SOS> as a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data <EOS>
<SOS> one cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we present a concept which based on existing tools allows communication between medical information systems <EOS>
<SOS> shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate <EOS>
<SOS> speed simplicity and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> in this study the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> the congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia <EOS>
<SOS> they are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy <EOS>
<SOS> there are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane <EOS>
<SOS> in addition patients with apparent cda of heterogenous phenotype are observed that cannot be attributed to any of the three types <EOS>

<SOS> chronic venous insufficiency cvi is characterised by stage dependent microangiopathy <EOS>
<SOS> with increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure <EOS>
<SOS> the cutaneous vascular reserve which is measured by laser doppler fluxmetry is reduced <EOS>
<SOS> cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with cvi <EOS>
<SOS> low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in a open prospective pilot study <NUM> patients suffering from cvi with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current dermapulse which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation <EOS>
<SOS> the average age of the patients was <NUM> years and the average duration of ulceration was <NUM> months <EOS>

<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> the 5th edition of the tnm classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors <EOS>
<SOS> the division of stage iv tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure <EOS>
<SOS> methods in a retrospective study the clinical course of <NUM> patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new tnm classification <EOS>
<SOS> in particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage iv especially in mucosal cancer <EOS>
<SOS> results in classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of the 4th edition of the tnm classification the following recurrence free 5 year survival rates for <NUM> cases of mucosal cancer were calculated stage i 91 0 stage ii 78 6 stage ii 61 4 stage iv 31 0 <EOS>
<SOS> the calculations based on the 5th edition yielded stage i 91 0 stage ii 77 2 stage ii 61 2 stage iva 32 4 stage ivb 25 3 stage ivc 3 6 <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> however a significant prognostic distinction between n2 stage iva and n3 metastasis stage ivb could not be found <EOS>
<SOS> the microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell <EOS>
<SOS> modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock out gene technology <EOS>
<SOS> these advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation ischemia reperfusion and transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd in germany <EOS>
<SOS> this article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against pgd <EOS>
<SOS> in the autor is view neither the fact that pgd is not a well established technique nor the danger that single cell analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that pgd is morally inacceptable <EOS>
<SOS> inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept pgd are highlighted <EOS>
<SOS> the use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing pgd is criticised <EOS>
<SOS> extensive counselling prior to pgd should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision <EOS>
<SOS> the sofa score a new system for patients with sepsis related diseases was introduced in <NUM> by the working group on sepsis related problems of the european society of intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to compare the new sofa score with the apache ii and mod scores <EOS>
<SOS> the data on <NUM> patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software spss for windows version 7 5 2 and ms excel 97 <EOS>

<SOS> in individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas hnscc established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome <EOS>
<SOS> for the first time we investigated a total of <NUM> hnscc by comparative genomic hybridization cgh to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> patients were followed for at latest <NUM> but at least <NUM> years after surgery or until death <EOS>
<SOS> during this observation period twenty nine of them died because of cancer disease <EOS>
<SOS> the kaplan meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico pathological parameter <EOS>
<SOS> the curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the breslow test <EOS>
<SOS> significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the cox regression model <EOS>
<SOS> the overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who is tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 p <MOB> for lr and p <MOB> for b <EOS>
<SOS> the survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q p <MOB> for lr and p <MOB> for b <EOS>
<SOS> multivariate analysis cox is proportional hazards model revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in hnscc <EOS>
<SOS> none of the conventional clinico pathological parameters pt pn status uicc stage grading achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model <EOS>
<SOS> these results suggest that in hnscc the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established tnm and grading criteria <EOS>
<SOS> we report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a <NUM> years old female patient <EOS>
<SOS> the foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed s 100 and vimentin <EOS>
<SOS> hmb45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> detection of hmb45 in some of the nevus associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation <EOS>
<SOS> we present to the best of our knowledge the first case of a malignant primary plaque type blue naevus in a 61 year old male <EOS>
<SOS> two biopsy specimens had been examined within <NUM> years and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor <EOS>
<SOS> locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi <EOS>
<SOS> the recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus <EOS>
<SOS> it is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in germany <EOS>
<SOS> the lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized western countries is about <NUM> new cases per year and 100 00 inhabitants <EOS>
<SOS> the increase of alcohol consumption over the last <NUM> years is associated with an increase of ethanol induced pancreatitis <EOS>
<SOS> one may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities such as ct scan cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare <EOS>
<SOS> due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in germany similar to well documented data from denmark <EOS>
<SOS> since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in germany it is likely that the present incidence of about <NUM> cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100 00 inhabitants will also decrease <EOS>
<SOS> process experiential pe therapy is a neo humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client centered emphasis on a genuine estecming empathic relationship and the active task focused process directive style of gestalt therapie <EOS>
<SOS> this form of treatment is scientifically validated grawe 1997 <EOS>
<SOS> its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory <EOS>
<SOS> it incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps <EOS>
<SOS> this second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks <EOS>
<SOS> at last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed and available outcome data is summarized <EOS>
<SOS> the human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations but also spontaneous fluctuations <EOS>
<SOS> this blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance <EOS>
<SOS> a well known phenomenon is the so called white coat hyptertension which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability <EOS>
<SOS> therefore it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration <EOS>
<SOS> the faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography ct feature of small bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled faeces like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate its prevalence significance and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed <NUM> consecutive cases of small intestine obstruction studied with ct in the last <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the faeces sign was recognizable in <NUM> cases 7 4 and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the <NUM> cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction <EOS>
<SOS> in our experience it is relatively uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the ct study of small bowel obstruction <EOS>

<SOS> this article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid asa from the first experiments at <NUM> until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in 1869 hermann kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug <EOS>
<SOS> because of the side effects for example the irritation of the stomach analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications <EOS>
<SOS> in august <NUM> felix hoffmann <MOB> was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid asa <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> kurt witthauer <MOB> collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of asa as an analgetic and antipyretic drug <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> asa was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time <EOS>

<SOS> despite wide spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide every year especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons <EOS>
<SOS> at present amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use yet the deployment of these substances is problematic neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza b their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance and they show many adverse effects <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast zanamivir and gs4071 gs4104 are rationally developed influenza specific neuraminidase inhibitors proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza a and b as well in vitro as in animal models and in experimental human studies <EOS>
<SOS> zanamivir and gs4071 gs4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration respectively <EOS>
<SOS> resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear <EOS>
<SOS> to date the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and amantadin rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30 48 h after onset of symptoms but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice <EOS>
<SOS> as neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity course of infection and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy <EOS>
<SOS> background and purpose without recanalisation acute basilar artery ba occlusion has a mortality of <NUM> which is reduced to <NUM> if recanalisation is achieved <EOS>
<SOS> fast diagnosis of ba occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay <EOS>

<SOS> over a period of about <NUM> h in physiological milieu the cement converts to hydroxyapatite <EOS>
<SOS> this product is no longer redissolvable <NUM> in normal body fluid <EOS>
<SOS> this cement can be used for non load bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery <EOS>
<SOS> cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial <EOS>
<SOS> in nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area <EOS>
<SOS> fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve <EOS>
<SOS> further applications could be all non load bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing aid electrodes <EOS>
<SOS> the perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics <EOS>
<SOS> we present a non invasive epilepsy surgery protocol which includes eeg video monitoring magnetic resonance imaging mri interictal positron emission tomography pet and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography spect <EOS>
<SOS> according to this non invasive protocol <NUM> of <NUM> patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of eeg video montoring mri interictal pet and ictal spect <EOS>
<SOS> 46 92 of the patients had temporal and <NUM> 8 had extratemporal epilepsies <EOS>
<SOS> 78 n 39 of all patients operated according to our non invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free <EOS>
<SOS> extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive eeg recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non invasive eeg evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> necrolytic migratory erythema nme is mostly associated with a pancreatic a cell glucagonoma and is considered to be a well defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome <EOS>

<SOS> abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above <NUM> mmhg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria <EOS>
<SOS> in primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma <EOS>
<SOS> secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the effects are decreased cardiac output pulmonary atelectasis oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure <EOS>
<SOS> normal values are between <NUM> and <NUM> cm h2o after elective laparotomies 5 12 cm h20 <EOS>
<SOS> above <NUM> cm h20 they are definitely pathological <EOS>
<SOS> for the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> cm h20 preoperatively which could be lowered to <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> cm h20 by laparostomy <EOS>
<SOS> an early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in <NUM> of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions the abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems <EOS>
<SOS> the temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances <EOS>

<SOS> following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in <NUM> to 30 of cases depending mainly on graft age <EOS>
<SOS> selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation depends on various parameters including coronary morphology left ventricular performance comorbidity and availability of graft material <EOS>
<SOS> catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis compared with native coronary arteries have to be expected <EOS>
<SOS> repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting <NUM> years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump graft supplying rca lad and cx sequentially making reintervention necessary <EOS>
<SOS> as a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention <EOS>
<SOS> intravascular ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long term result <EOS>

<SOS> in recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted <EOS>
<SOS> the use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety <EOS>
<SOS> the breast to tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1 2 cm are the most important factors in breast conserving surgery <EOS>
<SOS> different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected <EOS>
<SOS> other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi and contralateral breast tissue <EOS>
<SOS> reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations <EOS>
<SOS> the best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection <EOS>
<SOS> oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction <EOS>

<SOS> active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom control reduction of anxiety and depression and of conflict modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises <EOS>
<SOS> therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation <EOS>
<SOS> other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery not at the site of the pathology <EOS>

<SOS> in a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls risks and complications of transforaminal surgery <EOS>
<SOS> patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented <EOS>
<SOS> some <NUM> patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space excluding extremely medially situated herniations were treated <EOS>
<SOS> we used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the treated levels were l5 s1 11 l4 5 12 l3 4 3 and l2 3 1 <EOS>
<SOS> all areas could be reached by this approach <EOS>
<SOS> one procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems <EOS>
<SOS> one patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure <EOS>
<SOS> two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain <EOS>
<SOS> no signs of reherniation could be found in these cases but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring <EOS>
<SOS> minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> postoperative mri or ct scans revealed only little scar tissue <EOS>
<SOS> this impression was supported in the open revisions we performed <EOS>
<SOS> clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery <EOS>

<SOS> the iop elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry <EOS>
<SOS> due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional mri is the imaging method of <NUM> choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders <EOS>
<SOS> conventional mr imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments however in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and mr arthrography should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> mr arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures <EOS>
<SOS> this joint distension with mr arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> finally high contrast and joint distension by mr arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies which often require surgery <EOS>
<SOS> mr arthrography although invasive may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders <EOS>
<SOS> several studies have demonstrated an association chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease suggesting that infection with c pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor <NUM> or more <EOS>

<SOS> bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using ct and mri techniques <EOS>
<SOS> these unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis <EOS>
<SOS> they differ from the normal white matter signal <EOS>
<SOS> these changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than <NUM> years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis <EOS>
<SOS> this term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than <NUM> years with an unilateral onset asymmetric distribution and extensive changes all over the infra and supratentorial white matter area <EOS>
<SOS> neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter especially enlarged virchow robin spaces lacunar infarction subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy binswanger is disease leukoencephalopathy of different origin and demyelinating diseases <EOS>
<SOS> a case with various skeletal abnormalities soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as proteus syndrome is reported <EOS>
<SOS> proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations <EOS>
<SOS> it is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems <EOS>
<SOS> early diagnosis and careful follow up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long term complications <EOS>
<SOS> the value of elective pta in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion <EOS>
<SOS> stenoses after surgical and or radiation therapy and a high cardio vascular risk for a surgical procedure however justify minimal invasive techniques <EOS>
<SOS> profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> it was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations in order to estimate the relationship between pitch sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer assisted graph <EOS>
<SOS> a three dimensional 3d wireframe phonogram was constructed based on spl profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded <EOS>
<SOS> we have termed this phonetography <EOS>
<SOS> variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships <EOS>
<SOS> the results in <NUM> healthy volunteers and <NUM> patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3d phonograms produced depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft piano compared to loud forte <EOS>
<SOS> in one third of the healthy volunteers the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined <EOS>
<SOS> in two thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater as were those of piano voice duration <EOS>
<SOS> all of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the study demonstrate that the 3d phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters <EOS>
<SOS> sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes infiltrated by large histiocytes <EOS>
<SOS> these cells show typical cytophagocytosis particularly lymphophagocytosis <EOS>
<SOS> other organs may be also involved by this disease often including the skin <EOS>
<SOS> exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare <EOS>
<SOS> to exclude other non x histiocytoses or histiocytosis x it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a five year old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported <EOS>
<SOS> a presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina <EOS>
<SOS> after verification of the anatomical situation an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> positron emission tomography pet is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas hcc and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by pet <EOS>
<SOS> the ongoing study includes seven patients with child a cirrhosis and hcc uicc stage ii iva tumor size 3 6 cm <EOS>
<SOS> dynamic pet studies 60 min with 18f fluordeoxyglucose fdg were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of the fdg data demonstrated a liver equivalent uptake in six of the tumors well and moderately differentiated hcc which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma <EOS>
<SOS> one moderately differentiated hcc showed an increased fdg metabolism indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> a dose of 37 80 mbq 11c ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography <EOS>
<SOS> five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11c uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11c ethanol concentration during the whole study period of <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> the pet data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11c ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue <EOS>
<SOS> one case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11c ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11c uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion pet is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of hcc <EOS>
<SOS> during the last decade many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury ali or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards <EOS>
<SOS> however the increasing knowledge instead of clarification leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies <EOS>
<SOS> indeed many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ards of one etiology from another <EOS>
<SOS> we are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ards while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore in the clinical arena there is no clear distinction between pneumonia severe pneumonia which may lead to ali and then ards <EOS>
<SOS> finally the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge <EOS>
<SOS> this review is an analysis by an icu clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied emphasizing the complex interactions between them <EOS>
<SOS> the present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic therapeutic scoring system maris marburger intensive score offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems which are based either only physiologically apache ii acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii or only therapeutically tiss therapeutic intervention scoring system in medical intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay <EOS>
<SOS> during a 12 months period 1993 94 <NUM> consecutive patients icu stay 4 hours being admitted to a medical icu of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated <EOS>
<SOS> the day 1 scores of maris apache ii and tiss were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death <EOS>
<SOS> there was no advantage in using the combined scoring system maris neither in discrimination between survival and non survival hospital mortality areas under the roc curve maris 0 84 apache ii 0 86 tiss 0 78 nor in severity classification relationship between day 1 scores and hospital mortality p0 001 chi2 test in all three systems <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast only for the combined system maris a dependence of length of hospital stay from day 1 scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients survivors and non survivors p0 001 anova could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the combined physiologic therapeutic scoring system maris did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients <EOS>
<SOS> its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day 1 scores and length of hospital stay which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine <EOS>
<SOS> a <NUM> month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia mainly truncal rash and unclear pain <EOS>
<SOS> previously he had shown fever conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis thrombocytosis anemia and an elevation of esr and gamma globulins <EOS>
<SOS> no bacterial infection was found <EOS>
<SOS> the ecg showed signs of a myocardial ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> the sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery <EOS>
<SOS> the boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest <EOS>
<SOS> the autopsy verified the diagnosis of kawasaki syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail <EOS>
<SOS> depending on age history clinical picture and laboratory results an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure <EOS>
<SOS> several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples <EOS>
<SOS> the present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction crt pcr by quantifying in bovine tissues the specific mrnas for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism the low density lipoprotein ldl receptor and the 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase <EOS>
<SOS> our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mrnas <EOS>
<SOS> the ldl receptor mrna expression was highest in the adrenal gland 6 7 x <NUM> molecules ug cellular rna followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary intermediate in the liver 8 6 x <NUM> molecules ug cellular rna and not detectable in the large intestine <EOS>
<SOS> expression of the hmg coa reductase almost paralleled ldl receptor values <EOS>
<SOS> it was found to be highest in the ovary 6 1 x <NUM> molecules ug cellular rna followed by the adrenal gland intermediate in the liver 3 1 x <NUM> molecules ug cellular rna and lowest in the large intestine 9 9 x <NUM> molecules ug cellular rna <EOS>
<SOS> these data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches <EOS>
<SOS> thus crt pcr is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the ldl receptor and the hmg coa reductase <EOS>
<SOS> spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non surgical pain <EOS>
<SOS> central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids <EOS>
<SOS> this review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia including patient controlled epidural analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route <EOS>
<SOS> several factors may influence selection of the opioid however in most situations morphine is the drug of choice <EOS>
<SOS> thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia adverse effects doses required or pulmonary function <EOS>
<SOS> however evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating <EOS>
<SOS> in such patients combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia <EOS>
<SOS> however there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> this contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition which was held in evangelische akademie loccum germany may 20 21 <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> nutrition can be considered a medical treatment which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient evaluation of quality of life ql is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires <EOS>
<SOS> the ql questionnaire qlq c30 of the european organization for research and treatment of cancer eortc is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease related limitations of ql <EOS>
<SOS> the measurement of ql can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies e g percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy <EOS>
<SOS> in the individual case the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for ql may be confounded by other parameters such as disease or personal changes <EOS>
<SOS> however the information supports decision making about the indication the route of nutritional therapy as well as individual follow up <EOS>
<SOS> using ql as an outcome parameter carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative <EOS>
<SOS> the immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist <EOS>
<SOS> a graduated treatment scheme based on the asif classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement <EOS>
<SOS> the authors own patient population is presented in this paper in these patients fixation with kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty and for c type fractures according to the asif classification or when there is severe soft tissue damage application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best <EOS>
<SOS> treatment strategy risks complications and results are presented <EOS>
<SOS> many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help <EOS>
<SOS> in the heidelberg project of involuntary childlessness in men andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of <NUM> year is andrological treatment <EOS>
<SOS> cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management <EOS>
<SOS> therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> thorough history taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient is individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible <EOS>
<SOS> besides elaboration of medical therapy cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing <EOS>
<SOS> according to the literature chronic ankle instability occurs after acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments in 10 20 of the cases <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles <EOS>
<SOS> the standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma the clinical examination and radiological stress tests <EOS>
<SOS> newer diagnostic methods up to now not well established in clinical routine include stabilometry cybex measurements of the pronator muscles the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography <EOS>
<SOS> conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training <EOS>
<SOS> the indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list <NUM> anatomical repair eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> watson jones tenodesis and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> chrisman snook tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability <EOS>
<SOS> no other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers hcw as the aids pandemic <EOS>
<SOS> numerous epidemiological data however have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus hiv during surgical interventions is low it is <NUM> for all types of percutaneous exposures <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of hiv transmission in the operation theatre which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood borne pathogens <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of occupational exposure to hiv contaminated blood or body secretions post exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> <NUM> pachyonychia congenita pc comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma follicular keratoses and mucosal leukokeratoses <EOS>
<SOS> less frequently epidermal cysts hairshaft abnormalities natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen <EOS>
<SOS> phenotypically and genetically two major forms of pc are recognized pachyonychia congenita jadassohn lewandowsky pc type i medelian inheritance in man mim <MOB> and pachyonychia congenita jackson lawler pc type ii mim <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> both conditions show nail deformities focal palmoplantar keratoderma and follicular hyperkeratoses <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with pc type i <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast individuals affected with pc type ii show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk <EOS>
<SOS> the latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex <EOS>
<SOS> by mutational analysis keratin k6a and k16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with pc type i and keratin k6b and k17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with pc type ii <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding administration of blood products and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem dil administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective cabg <EOS>
<SOS> we retrospectively analyzed the surgical and icu records of cabg patients who had recieved dil 27 pats <EOS>
<SOS> or nitroglycerin ntg <NUM> pats <EOS>
<SOS> or a combination thereof com <NUM> pats <EOS>
<SOS> data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding ctb frequency of administration of packed red blood cells rbc and fresh frozen plasma ffp and changes in hemoglobin hb thrombocyte th levels as well as changes in prothrombin pt and partial thromboplastine time ptt <EOS>
<SOS> there were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data <EOS>
<SOS> the amount of ctb as well as the use of rbc and ffp were not significantly different between the groups <EOS>
<SOS> also there were no significant differences with regard to hb or th and pt or ptt both in the early phase after the operation in icu as well as after <NUM> hours in the icu <EOS>
<SOS> the perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker dil reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during cabg surgery <EOS>
<SOS> this administration during cabg surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> as compared to ntg dil does not have negative effects on hb and th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first <NUM> hours in the icu after cabg surgery <EOS>
<SOS> depression and fibromyalgia fm share common symptoms indicating a close relationship between both disorders <EOS>
<SOS> fm patients frequently present symptoms of major depression <EOS>
<SOS> genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component <EOS>
<SOS> molecular genetic studies are on the way the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and fm <EOS>
<SOS> biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders <EOS>
<SOS> this view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants <EOS>
<SOS> at our hospital closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation <EOS>
<SOS> indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries <EOS>
<SOS> during a period of <NUM> years <NUM> patients were treated according to this strategy <EOS>
<SOS> of these patients <NUM> had simple dislocations of the elbow and <NUM> suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients follow ups could be performed after a mean period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> in more than <NUM> of cases good or excellent functional results were documented unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions <EOS>
<SOS> nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding pet in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation <EOS>
<SOS> in a series of <NUM> autopsies the over all occurrence of pet was 13 3 <EOS>
<SOS> the highest frequencies were found in fire victims 31 persons who had died after intensive care 24 cardiac death 22 drowning and intoxication 16 each <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of pet decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass <EOS>
<SOS> at first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr seemed to influence the occurrence of pet because the rate was 11 without and 19 with cpr x2 p 0 05 an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> however further analysis showed that a higher rate of pet could only be observed in causes of death where pet are often fround irrespective of cpr whereas in the other groups pet with or without cpr are uncommon <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore a case by case analysis showed that in several cases with pet after cpr the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than cpr <EOS>
<SOS> in a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths 181 cases the influence of age and body mass on the rate of pet was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent pet with increasing heart weight <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand no statistically significant influence of cpr on the rate of pet could be found in this relatively homogeneous group <EOS>
<SOS> media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the european alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate <EOS>
<SOS> although objective data is lacking the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in germany austria the southern tirol switzerland and the chamonix region in france were analysed with respect to the fatal and non fatal accidents which occurred between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> because of varying definitions of mountain accident used in these countries available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable <EOS>
<SOS> a 75 year old man had painless slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions <EOS>
<SOS> clinically the tumors were nontender and semimobile <EOS>
<SOS> mr imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs <EOS>
<SOS> at surgery the tumors were thought to be malignant most likely liposarcomas <EOS>
<SOS> the histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle shaped fibroblasts which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers <EOS>
<SOS> elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the patients bilateral often asynchronous tumors are seen <EOS>
<SOS> ninety nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region <EOS>
<SOS> occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities head and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities <EOS>
<SOS> the relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> only case reports of one or more patients exist <EOS>
<SOS> optimal therapy therefore remains controversial and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred if no contraindications exist <EOS>
<SOS> two cases are presented together with a literature review <EOS>
<SOS> the comèl netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease <EOS>
<SOS> a 23 year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to <NUM> cm length and atopic diathesis <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless more than <NUM> years passed before the final diagnosis was established <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion more severe than previously reported <EOS>
<SOS> oral therapy with acitretin was quite successful <EOS>
<SOS> background recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes <EOS>
<SOS> autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing <EOS>
<SOS> in vitro fertilisation ivf and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection icsi are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction <EOS>
<SOS> whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired cryptozoospermia severe oat syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal ivf icsi might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper a number of additional icsi indications are defined for example minor forms of andrological subfertility reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional ivf reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms reduced quality of oocytes or icsi after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in ivf <EOS>
<SOS> load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> the loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot <EOS>
<SOS> this stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury <EOS>
<SOS> however a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials <EOS>
<SOS> in the past the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect but may be increasingly important in the future <EOS>
<SOS> with optimal clinical management of patients with marfan syndrome life expectancy may be improved substantially from <NUM> years to a nearly normal life span <EOS>
<SOS> cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling life style management and cardiovascular surveillance which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> prophylactic use of beta blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized <EOS>
<SOS> juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with marfan syndrome pose particular problems <EOS>
<SOS> this review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies <EOS>
<SOS> finally a review of the most recent advantages to somatic gene therapy is given <EOS>
<SOS> in different animal investigations pyrost demonstrated osteoconductive and osteostimulative effects <EOS>
<SOS> in ectopic tissues and especially in conditions of low osteogenetic potency the combination of pyrost and autogenic bone marrow effects bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> in germany good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed <EOS>
<SOS> good supranational industry sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new expensive drugs <EOS>
<SOS> the preconditions for co operation in conducting industry independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in germany by instituting the working group of co operating arthritis centers the so called core documentation where <NUM> patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in <NUM> and the institution of a sophisticated information system rheumanet <EOS>
<SOS> the executive board of the german rheumatology association has set up an ad hoc commission that agreed to institute a committee for the coordination of clinical studies in rheumatic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> in this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine orthopedic pediatrics working in universities hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented <EOS>
<SOS> in principle this committee is independent of the co operating arthritis centers and the rheumanet <EOS>
<SOS> all members of the german rheumatology association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> the committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions <EOS>
<SOS> in addition study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance quality and feasibility <EOS>
<SOS> abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period <EOS>
<SOS> nearly 70 of patients visits to the gynecologist in the peri and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> according to the speed hypothesis of cognitive development the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence <EOS>
<SOS> the present study investigates the speed hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using latent growth curve methodology <EOS>
<SOS> date on <NUM> measurement points come from the bonn longitudinal study of aging n 128 mean age 67 2 53 women <EOS>
<SOS> based on principal factor analysis markers of mental speed were the wais digit symbol test and simple psychomotor task <EOS>
<SOS> as indicators of fluid intelligence the wais object assembly and block design were used <EOS>
<SOS> after separately fitting latent growth curve models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope factors <EOS>
<SOS> interpreting this result contrary to the speed hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed <EOS>
<SOS> for patients with dilative cardiomyopathy dcm the prognosis is highly unfavorable even under conditions of optimal medication <EOS>
<SOS> at present there is no option for causal therapy <EOS>
<SOS> since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies e g against <NUM> ad renergic or muscarinergic receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of dcm the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> the effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for dcm patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked <EOS>
<SOS> a pilot study conducted among dcm patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement <EOS>
<SOS> these results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in dcm and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept <EOS>
<SOS> active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo <EOS>
<SOS> for melanoma the following approaches are suggested vaccination with tumour specific hla associated antigens using peptides or `naked dna vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or b7 adoptive immunotherapy with specific t lymphocytes or transfected tumour infiltrating lymphocytes or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> since 1995 a total of <NUM> patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment <EOS>
<SOS> after the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the mean follow up period for all patients was <NUM> months range 3 50 months <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases 75 7 bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> apart from low grade local reactions swelling haematoma petechiae no complications were observed <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology <EOS>
<SOS> extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing <EOS>
<SOS> the sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis comep were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions <EOS>
<SOS> this system uses a mechanical middle ear model mm which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear <EOS>
<SOS> the implants were fitted under defined conditions into the mm <EOS>
<SOS> displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the mm was measured with an optical probe <EOS>
<SOS> the measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission <EOS>
<SOS> the lightest implant 4 mg titanium showed the best results <EOS>
<SOS> the comep revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane <EOS>
<SOS> these findings show that the comep is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range <EOS>
<SOS> in a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the mm with different forces <EOS>
<SOS> the increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity <EOS>
<SOS> hence the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range <EOS>
<SOS> angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis m bourneville pringle <EOS>
<SOS> clinically this long term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass <EOS>
<SOS> due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures <EOS>
<SOS> in view of two of our own case reports the therapeutic strategies are discussed paying regard to the actual literature in this field <EOS>
<SOS> the excact pathogenesis of peyronie is disease pd is still unknown <EOS>
<SOS> histopathological investigations suggest that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of <NUM> patients with pd and <NUM> healthy controls <EOS>
<SOS> we mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood wich correspond to the collagen metabolism procollagen ii p ii p pmn elastase pmn e fibronectin fn fibronectinreceptor fn r und 1 proteinase inhibitor 1 pi <EOS>
<SOS> there was no difference in pmn e p ii p fn and fn r in all samples <EOS>
<SOS> there was no difference in penile and venous blood as well <EOS>
<SOS> but we found out a highly significant lower concentration of 1 pi in patients with pd 158 55 mg dl than in controls 214 82 mg dl <EOS>
<SOS> closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare <EOS>
<SOS> fewer than <NUM> cases have been reported in the literature perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor <EOS>
<SOS> most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections <EOS>
<SOS> clinically the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening swelling or neurological signs <EOS>
<SOS> differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded <EOS>
<SOS> during the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination <EOS>
<SOS> an operation may be undertaken up to <NUM> months after the injury <EOS>
<SOS> preferred procedures are end to end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon followed by a plaster cast for <NUM> weeks postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> high risk patients can be treated conservatively but the functional results are less satisfactory <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon <EOS>
<SOS> a yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented <EOS>

<SOS> background according to literature 30 60 of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation paf <EOS>
<SOS> as rapid tracking of paf may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers refined algorithms providing av synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during paf are highly desirable <EOS>
<SOS> aim and method this comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching ms algorithm which uses either a fixed inos2cls or programmable logos number of short intervals out of <NUM> consecutive atrial intervals to detect paf <EOS>
<SOS> if the ms criterion is fulfilled a switch from av synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed <EOS>
<SOS> the algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the ms sensitivity and specificity <EOS>
<SOS> results this ms concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards paf of the mode conversion in actros and kairos pacemaker systems preventing a long time delay between onset of paf detection of the arrhythmia and switch to nontracking mode <EOS>
<SOS> in addition adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new ms concept enable reliable ms <EOS>
<SOS> the occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested as it may lead to inappropriate ms programmability of the ms algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations <EOS>
<SOS> finally examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess ms reliability identify possible problems and optimize ms function during follow up <EOS>

<SOS> introduction coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world <EOS>
<SOS> although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography sca is beyond dispute the associated risk of an invasive approach the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non invasive techniques for coronary imaging <EOS>
<SOS> intravenous coronary angiography ica has been shown to permit non invasive imaging of the coronary arteries <EOS>
<SOS> we report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders <EOS>
<SOS> the somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology or it occurred in addition to a well known psychiatric disorder <EOS>
<SOS> for general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders <EOS>
<SOS> if patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> penetrating neck injuries are potentially life threatening injuries <EOS>
<SOS> management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> an algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality <EOS>
<SOS> in the department of trauma surgery of vienna medical school mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced <EOS>
<SOS> thirty one patients with this kind of injury were treated between august <NUM> and september <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots in eight cases by broken glass in one case by an iron rod in one case by a spear in one case by a branch and in <NUM> cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives <EOS>
<SOS> complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen <EOS>

<SOS> in a long term follow up we evaluated <NUM> patients out of <NUM> 73 with a subtalar fusion <EOS>
<SOS> the operations took place from 5 84 to 5 91 <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases the indication for the fusion was a post traumatic arthritis after an intra articular os calcis fracture <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems a <EOS>
<SOS> the outcome questionnaire rating patient is complaints and the functional status based on the severity symptom scale and functional status described for carpaltunnel syndrome by levine et al <EOS>

<SOS> the statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance anova <EOS>
<SOS> level of significance was based on p <NUM> and calculation of pearson is correlation coefficient <EOS>
<SOS> the os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all <NUM> patients 33 males and <NUM> females <EOS>
<SOS> the primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative cons <EOS>
<SOS> using a plaster in <NUM> patients 57 5 while <NUM> patients 42 5 underwent open reduction and plate fixation op <EOS>
<SOS> the interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged <NUM> years 3 months to <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> the interval between subtalar fusion and follow up averaged <NUM> years 4 14 years <EOS>

<SOS> the statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types <EOS>
<SOS> in all evaluation systems a score between <NUM> and <NUM> points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical radiological scoring systems <EOS>
<SOS> for the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation <EOS>
<SOS> objectives correction of an overriding fifth toe <EOS>
<SOS> non palpable breast lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal <EOS>
<SOS> the consequences are larger tissue defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete <EOS>
<SOS> digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation abbi procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared <EOS>
<SOS> either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity specificity and accuracy of the methods <EOS>
<SOS> chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so called mixed tumors like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands <EOS>
<SOS> the histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed in particular with respect to its stromal component <EOS>
<SOS> the distribution of cytokeratins cks cea ema vimentin s 100 protein desmin and actin smooth muscle actin sma was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type <EOS>
<SOS> the neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures solid nests aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology <EOS>
<SOS> the innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of cks kl1 and mnf116 cea and ema while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin s 100 was expressed to a lesser extent and kl1 weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of mnf116 <EOS>
<SOS> whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin s 100 protein mnf116 markedly and kl1 weakly the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin s 100 protein and focally cks and sma <EOS>
<SOS> anti sma specifically detects myoepithelial cells <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma <EOS>
<SOS> leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases <EOS>
<SOS> most frequently they are due to vasculopathies to a lesser extent to metabolic neuropathic or hematologic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> neoplasms connective tissue diseases infections trauma and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> a 38 year old caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers <EOS>
<SOS> the ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments <EOS>
<SOS> additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation short stature extensive dental caries and multiple malar teleangiectases <EOS>
<SOS> hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease <EOS>
<SOS> it is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism <EOS>
<SOS> ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> so far there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> all reported treatment attempts have ended in failure <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper the basic features of acute subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms culture studies laboratory studies and radiological signs <EOS>
<SOS> the common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in the treatment of post traumatic postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains <EOS>
<SOS> thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed <EOS>
<SOS> despite this improved prognosis an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis treatment and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus <EOS>
<SOS> thus physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics <EOS>
<SOS> very early i e in 1984 the german medical association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the german government saw the need in <NUM> for an embryo protection law embryonenschutzgesetz <EOS>
<SOS> today in the light of european integration the medical profession is and state is obligations are challenged in different ways <EOS>
<SOS> whereas the german medical association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine i e in the areas of inheritance law adoption law family law and law of succession the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs social paternity in heterologous insemination <EOS>
<SOS> in crohn is disease some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin b12 or folic acid opticus neuropathy and polyneuropathy have been described <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral vasculitis secondary to crohn is disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three such cases in three female patients aged 26 29 and <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> all patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis one complained additionally of a speech disorder headache and intermittent loss of orientation <EOS>
<SOS> in ct and mri scans multiple lesions were detected cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle and large sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis <EOS>
<SOS> serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time <EOS>
<SOS> under anticoagulation in two cases and immunosuppressive therapy neurologic symptoms disappeared <EOS>
<SOS> in the following <NUM> to <NUM> months no new neurological symptoms appeared <EOS>
<SOS> in two cases doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and in one case progressive intracranial stenoses <EOS>
<SOS> the serin protease tryptase ecnr <EOS>
<SOS> <URL> which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators e g <EOS>
<SOS> histamine into the extracellular space and the circulation <EOS>
<SOS> the capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue remodeling processes <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in the skin a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions but also in other inflammatory diseases degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing where an accumulation and or activation of mast cells is found <EOS>
<SOS> extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions <EOS>
<SOS> its absence during histamine liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation <EOS>
<SOS> in addition tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues <EOS>
<SOS> background since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively <EOS>
<SOS> flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy <EOS>
<SOS> surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement ao classification <NUM> a1 b1 b3 and c1 c3 makes high demands on traumatological management <EOS>
<SOS> by using modern minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta articular fractures it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra articular injuries a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods <EOS>
<SOS> from a total of <NUM> patients with tibial plateau fractures arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in <NUM> patients at our clinic from september <NUM> to january <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up of a total of <NUM> patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the lysholm and delamarter score <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest that arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of ao classification <NUM> c1 c3 fractures <EOS>
<SOS> dorsal tension band fixation is a wide spread technique of finger arthrodesis <EOS>
<SOS> when using a resorbable pds suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed <EOS>
<SOS> aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup in cone procedure <EOS>
<SOS> freeze preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the pds material series 1 the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers series 3 freeze preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating wire loop series 2 are load in a four point bending in the direction of palmarflexion <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> degrees onwards the wire tension system requires a higher torque for bending but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture <EOS>
<SOS> the examination shows that the thread tension band method by pds loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces <EOS>
<SOS> modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments <EOS>
<SOS> one recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body <EOS>
<SOS> one major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain dead person as dead <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post mortem organ donation because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs other than the brain remain viable <EOS>
<SOS> the objection implies scepticism as to the physician is ability to distinguish a dead from a living person <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand even the critics must rely on the physician is ability to discriminate e g when to discontinue resuscitation <EOS>
<SOS> the medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma <NUM> years after its first formulation <EOS>
<SOS> it must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation <EOS>
<SOS> one ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor but another person the recipient <EOS>
<SOS> the concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he she consents to as immanuel kant stated <EOS>
<SOS> although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person the life interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate <EOS>
<SOS> the resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor is consent as far as possible <EOS>
<SOS> the proposed information model seems adequate at the moment <EOS>
<SOS> a common report of both churches in germany in <NUM> supported postmortem organ transplantation <EOS>
<SOS> the report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the christian value of solidarity <EOS>
<SOS> the ethical alternatives to organ transplantation however are not mentioned <EOS>
<SOS> within this limitation the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour is life interest <EOS>
<SOS> starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport <EOS>
<SOS> elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour <EOS>
<SOS> driver assistance systems just available or soon on the market are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers <EOS>
<SOS> an expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are emergency systems enhanced vision systems and parking aids <EOS>
<SOS> emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver is request and direct them to the emergency location <EOS>
<SOS> self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping <EOS>
<SOS> parking aids using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems <EOS>
<SOS> the group of helpful but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car comprising autonomous cruise control antilock systems and electronic stability programmes <EOS>
<SOS> the value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory <EOS>
<SOS> reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems <EOS>
<SOS> the article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man machine interface for elderly to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic <EOS>
<SOS> causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism <EOS>
<SOS> drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double blind placebo controlled randomized studies <EOS>
<SOS> the results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in addition antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility <EOS>
<SOS> inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy e g with kallikein tamoxifen clomiphene pentoxifylline mast cell blockers testolacton vitamin e captopril alpha receptor blockers glutathione indometacin interferon alpha growth hormone zinc salts ketoprofen mesterone or testosterone undecanoate or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement <EOS>
<SOS> recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure fsh while gnrh and fsh have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with alzheimer is disease ad in <NUM> patients with non ad dementia and in <NUM> cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid csf <EOS>
<SOS> of the ad patients <NUM> were very mildly demented mmse score from <NUM> to 28 <EOS>
<SOS> even in these patients csf tau was significantly more elevated than in controls <EOS>
<SOS> in the non ad patients protein tau was less increased <EOS>
<SOS> among the ad patients there was no association between csf tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow determined by spect <EOS>
<SOS> our findings suggest that csf tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of ad and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> the accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored <EOS>
<SOS> one in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> of these patients it is estimated that 20 40 have perioperative myocardial ischaemia pmi the majority being nonsymptomatic <EOS>
<SOS> this figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction <EOS>
<SOS> the anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae <EOS>
<SOS> this can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs <EOS>
<SOS> nitrocompounds nitrates molsidomine serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment <EOS>
<SOS> acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia <EOS>
<SOS> beta blockers reduce the rate of pmi to a greater extent than nitrates <EOS>
<SOS> they are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate <EOS>
<SOS> single pre operative administration of beta blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia hypertension and pmi <EOS>
<SOS> consequently such one time medication can be considered for previously untreated high risk patients presenting for surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of pmi and myocardial infarction in coronary bypass patients and combination with beta blockers enhances this effect <EOS>
<SOS> intra operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to nitrates calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm <EOS>
<SOS> drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease however they also cause increased perioperative bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> consequently it is recommended that these medications be discontinued <NUM> <NUM> days prior to major surgery with the exception of high risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> pilot studies using alpha2 agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in pmi <EOS>
<SOS> the perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated <EOS>
<SOS> beta blockers calcium channel blockers nitrates and possibly alpha2 agonists lead to reduced rates of pmi and other cardiac complications in risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> current anti anginal medications with the exception of anti platelet agents should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter <EOS>
<SOS> all of these drugs except anti platelet agents may also be used intra operatively however possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered <EOS>
<SOS> inflammatory bowel diseases crohn is disease ulcerative colitis were thought to be psychosomatic disorders <EOS>
<SOS> however this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases ibd <EOS>
<SOS> in the present paper the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of ibd is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective <EOS>
<SOS> results covering the following topics are presented epidemiology sociodemographic variables genetic factors dietary factors and cigarette smoking drugs permeability of bowel epithelia immunological factors microbiological factors psychiatric disorders affective symptoms personality factors life events and psychosocial stress quality of life and coping with the illness <EOS>
<SOS> among biomedical factors a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable <EOS>
<SOS> however the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease but rather a kind of disposition <EOS>
<SOS> the question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation <EOS>
<SOS> interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho neuro immunological research in this area <EOS>
<SOS> results of research on psychological pathology psychiatric disorders personality factors are inconclusive <EOS>
<SOS> in particular some modern well controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature <EOS>
<SOS> part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects <EOS>
<SOS> research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results <EOS>
<SOS> prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations <EOS>
<SOS> however coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> finally perspectives for future research are suggested <EOS>
<SOS> genital infection particularly bacterial vaginosis bv increases the relative risk of prematurity <EOS>
<SOS> detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate <EOS>
<SOS> a pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition <EOS>
<SOS> most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography <EOS>
<SOS> we report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole <EOS>
<SOS> the pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy <EOS>
<SOS> the non molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus <EOS>
<SOS> no malignancy occured post partum <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> so far necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic primarily vascular arterial or mechanical causation <EOS>
<SOS> these models seem problematic since neither the patients histories nor the macroscopic radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of <NUM> cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the department of orthopaedics at the university hospital in heidelberg between <NUM> and <NUM> made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition <EOS>
<SOS> x ray material core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in <NUM> patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available <EOS>
<SOS> a stage by stage progression emerged which initially caused alterations only in the mr image while the x ray picture remained unremarkable <EOS>
<SOS> it was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it <EOS>
<SOS> this meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone <EOS>
<SOS> the spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage related classification for lunate bone necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> in a pressure measurement test the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in <NUM> necrotic lunate bones <NUM> healthy lunate bones and <NUM> healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist <EOS>
<SOS> the position dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy <EOS>
<SOS> the pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure <EOS>
<SOS> it was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally <EOS>
<SOS> after staining of both the arteries and the veins epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension <EOS>
<SOS> visualization of the vessels showed that capsular ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries but substantially hindered venous drainage <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented this explained the pronounced pressure increases <EOS>
<SOS> the unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation while manual work had an important role <EOS>
<SOS> most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension <EOS>
<SOS> any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk <EOS>
<SOS> thus our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist which is initially physiological before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course <EOS>
<SOS> the results of the german national health interview and examination survey <NUM> confirm allergies as widespread diseases in germany <EOS>
<SOS> in total <NUM> to <NUM> of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease <EOS>
<SOS> the morbidity was assessed using a self administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician <EOS>
<SOS> the agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than <NUM> for allergic rhinitis food allergy and urticaria and about <NUM> for contact dermatitis and asthma <EOS>
<SOS> the results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between east and west germany <EOS>
<SOS> using the interview data <NUM> of the west but only <NUM> of the east german adults have had e g <EOS>
<SOS> comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis <EOS>
<SOS> many people with allergies suffer or have suffered from several allergies <EOS>
<SOS> frequent patterns of combination are food allergy allergic rhinitis and asthma allergic rhinitis <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with former studies we observed an increase of <NUM> in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis between 1990 92 and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the relative increase is higher in east than in west <EOS>
<SOS> the time trend in prevalence of asthma could only be calculated for the west german population <EOS>

<SOS> echocardiography revealed an impressive displacement of the heart chambers to the left caused by a large aneurysm 11x5x5 cm located anteriorly and medially from the right heart communicating with the right atrium <EOS>
<SOS> pronounced compression of the basal part of the right ventricle was present <EOS>
<SOS> within the aneurysmatic cavity several highly mobile thrombi and extensive spontaneous echo contrast were demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> on magnetic resonance imaging and right heart angiocardiography the aneurysm was visualized as well <EOS>
<SOS> coronary angiography revealed a marked curved displacement of the right coronary artery to the left side <EOS>

<SOS> the relevance of skin secretions and their interactions with keratinized hair fibers is outlined <EOS>
<SOS> for the emergency treatment of sustained hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice <EOS>
<SOS> mostly class i antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine or ajmaline are preferred <EOS>
<SOS> in hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia electrical cardioversion should be applied in case of recurrences followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class i antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone <EOS>
<SOS> for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death blockers and or amiodarone are the only effective drugs <EOS>
<SOS> in the secondary prevention only the implantable cardioverter defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type constituting about <NUM> of all thyroid cancers <EOS>
<SOS> higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature <EOS>
<SOS> the value of preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy is not clearly proven for insular carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> the criteria for histological diagnosis have been outlined by carcangiu et al <EOS>
<SOS> because of its aggressiveness radical treatment at primary surgery appears advisable <EOS>
<SOS> its clear distinction from undifferentiated anaplastic and medullary c cell cancers is important as thyroglobulin is regularly synthesized by cancer cells <EOS>
<SOS> enrichment of radioactive iodine makes such treatment feasible postoperatively and at relapse <EOS>
<SOS> follow up should be performed as in highly differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer <EOS>
<SOS> a patient series of eight cases is presented <EOS>
<SOS> while all cancers were advanced at the initial diagnosis the observed disease courses were in agreement with the assumption that insular carcinoma is a more aggressive form of differentiated thyroid cancer <EOS>
<SOS> the result of an investigation of <NUM> from <NUM> 45 2 medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of hannover is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> besides we found gender school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to other studies the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in hannover is not ensured <EOS>

<SOS> the semitendinosus tendon left attached distally is passed through a tunnel in the tibial epiphysis led through the joint passed behind the lateral femoral condyle and fixed to the outer aspect of the femur with a staple <EOS>
<SOS> the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death <EOS>
<SOS> we report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15 month old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography <EOS>
<SOS> a reimplantation of the ano origin of the coronary artery was carried out wihtout using extra corporal circulation <EOS>
<SOS> there were no postoperative complications <EOS>
<SOS> due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases <EOS>
<SOS> the surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae vvf is a matter of controversy <EOS>
<SOS> this study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from vvf <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and 1996 <NUM> patients with vvf were treated surgically <EOS>
<SOS> the vvf occurred in the course of hysterectomy in <NUM> patients was due to radiotherapy in 7 was a result of obstetric complications in <NUM> patients and occurred after colporrhaphy in <NUM> patient <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of these <NUM> patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally <EOS>
<SOS> fourteen of these <NUM> patients 23 had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the vvf 1 to <NUM> procedures <EOS>
<SOS> transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in <NUM> of these <NUM> patients 92 <EOS>
<SOS> the other <NUM> patients were successfully treated by a second procedure again transvaginal n 3 transabdominal n 2 <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the transvaginal approach to close vvf is of advantage avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> in the vast majority of the cases isolated vvf can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair <EOS>
<SOS> myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle brain heart eyes and endocrine organs <EOS>
<SOS> the underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide ctg repeat in the 3 prime untranslated region of a serine threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q <EOS>
<SOS> a statistical correlation exists between the ctg copy number and the severity of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the ctg repeat than is seen in the non congenital myotonic dystrophy population <EOS>
<SOS> however not all patients with many ctg copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy <EOS>
<SOS> we present <NUM> patients with more than <NUM> ctg trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course <EOS>
<SOS> whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium and subsequently during lactation and breast feeding <EOS>
<SOS> the necessity for lithium prophylaxis in manic depressive women after childbirth has been identified and it is recommended that weaning rather than omission of psychopharmacological treatment is preferable during the puerperium <EOS>

<SOS> in <NUM> patients with <NUM> coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis ds was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography dqca by use of an on line computer workstation <EOS>
<SOS> the decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting prima vista ptca was based on history evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of ds <EOS>
<SOS> dqca measurements of the <NUM> stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 11 3 <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to dqca visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at 55 between two peaks at 45 and 75 and a mean of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> 19 6 <EOS>
<SOS> visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30 55 and overestimated the ds between 55 99 <EOS>
<SOS> visual estimation revealed a ds 60 in <NUM> stenoses 74 0 of the <NUM> lesions an estimate that led to subsequent prima vista ptca <EOS>
<SOS> conversely dqca revealed only <NUM> stenoses 54 3 with a ds 60 thus <NUM> stenoses 25 3 did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for ptca <EOS>
<SOS> the bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for self referral of patients for ptca <EOS>
<SOS> dqca serves as an objective tool in the decision making process for ptca and may reduce cosmetic interventions or justify to defer ptca <EOS>
<SOS> especially in the selection process for prima vista ptca dqca quantification of stenosis severity is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> s 100 protein and neuron specific enolase nse serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery neurology or after head injury <EOS>
<SOS> in these circumstances s 100 and nse levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests <EOS>
<SOS> the present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement <EOS>
<SOS> since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> however the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years <EOS>
<SOS> as can be substantiated by many data reported in literature there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions <EOS>
<SOS> orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance syncope or dangerous falls <EOS>
<SOS> a sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt table test <EOS>
<SOS> three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated <EOS>
<SOS> the hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure systolic drop 20 mmhg below base line within <NUM> min with or without compensatory tachycardia <EOS>
<SOS> it is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> tachycardia 30 beats per minute above base line within <NUM> min without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> in general there is no further somatic dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism <EOS>
<SOS> a reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia <EOS>
<SOS> proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension of the a agonist midodrin postural tachycardia syndrome and of b blockers neurocardiogenic syncope <EOS>
<SOS> there are numerous diseases which can irreversibly stiffen the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton <EOS>
<SOS> due to didactic reasons one can distinguish <NUM> gropus of such disorders <NUM> paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness <EOS>
<SOS> <NUM> rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine <EOS>
<SOS> <NUM> rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena <EOS>
<SOS> modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks <EOS>
<SOS> however surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis <EOS>
<SOS> functional aspects are of elementary importance <EOS>
<SOS> a 79 year old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis <NUM> days after transrectal ultrasound guided prostatic biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels <EOS>
<SOS> a similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy associated complication has not been described previously <EOS>
<SOS> the judicial enquiries were discontinued <EOS>
<SOS> several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome with individual sensitivities differing significantly <EOS>
<SOS> one explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles <EOS>
<SOS> a difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration <EOS>
<SOS> for this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass <EOS>
<SOS> since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles we selected fish salmon and trout as our study model to facilitation preparations <EOS>
<SOS> the maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17 and was generally smaller in the utricle although in individual cases was much higher <EOS>
<SOS> we assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place <EOS>
<SOS> decompensation leads to kinetosis under non physiological motion patterns <EOS>
<SOS> when the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical features diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis a rare illness are described <EOS>
<SOS> of clinical note are the pain pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement <EOS>
<SOS> staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described <EOS>
<SOS> sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> mr tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci spondylitis pelvis osteomyelitis <EOS>
<SOS> in our view the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment <EOS>
<SOS> interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis <EOS>
<SOS> little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids gc <EOS>
<SOS> in bone tissue osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying gc cytokine interactions <EOS>
<SOS> hence we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines saos 2 and mg 63 with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive il 6 production 3 4 <NUM> mean <NUM> se and <NUM> <NUM> pg 106 cells <EOS>
<SOS> we measured glucocorticoid receptor gr number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of il 6 <EOS>
<SOS> incubation for <NUM> h with il 6 at increasing concentrations up to <NUM> pg ml yielded a significant increase of gr binding sites in both cell lines <EOS>
<SOS> il 6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone 1 µmol l on gr in both cell lines <EOS>
<SOS> in mg 63 cells expressing higher concentrations of gr il 6 deprivation via a specific anti il 6 antibody 100 ng ml significantly decreased gr <EOS>
<SOS> in saos 2 cells expressing lower concentrations of gr a <NUM> h treatment with human il 1 10 ng ml significantly increased both il 6 production and gr <EOS>
<SOS> this latter effect was completely abolished by co treating the cells with the anti il 6 antibody <EOS>
<SOS> our results provide evidence that il 6 is an autocrine positive modulator of gr number in human osteoblasts <EOS>
<SOS> tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy <EOS>
<SOS> however in advanced malignant disease this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality <EOS>
<SOS> adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed <EOS>
<SOS> therefore long term survival remains unaffected <EOS>
<SOS> advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems <EOS>
<SOS> modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings <EOS>
<SOS> the probability of complete r0 resections necessary to improve long term survival can be enhanced by these therapies <EOS>
<SOS> the ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging <EOS>
<SOS> the simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare <EOS>
<SOS> objective findings are of special interest if it happens <EOS>
<SOS> a patient with alleged deafness on the left hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital <EOS>
<SOS> pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left hand side and normal hearing on the right hand side <EOS>
<SOS> however stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right at <NUM> to <NUM> khz with a stimulation of approxamately <NUM> db spl <EOS>
<SOS> transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions teoae and distortion product otoacoustic emissions dpoae were measured <EOS>
<SOS> the teoae had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides such that inner ear function could not be evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison the dp gram showed clear dp amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides <EOS>
<SOS> nonphysiological dps could be excluded by assessing the dp growth rate at three different frequencies <EOS>
<SOS> by means of brainstem electric response audiometry bera with which the iv v complex was detectable up to stimulation with <NUM> db spl clicks and the stenger test a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded <EOS>
<SOS> normal hearing on the left hand side was thus confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by dpoae <EOS>
<SOS> dpoae therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests <EOS>
<SOS> controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis ra have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid gcs function but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens aa <EOS>
<SOS> such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to ra in younger women <EOS>
<SOS> however recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas levels before x <NUM> yrs the onset of the disease pre ra offer an alternative perspective <EOS>
<SOS> significant dissociation of serum cortisol and dheas levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed ra before age <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> this subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum dheas levels <EOS>
<SOS> a growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery <EOS>
<SOS> despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the german society for trauma surgery dgu has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes <EOS>
<SOS> this role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in germany for quality assessment education and training research and adequate public relations <EOS>

<SOS> the criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described <EOS>
<SOS> follow up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation 0 2 in comparison to patients with modification of a single av nodal pathway 8 12 <EOS>
<SOS> alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total av nodal block which occured in <NUM> patients 1 1 <EOS>
<SOS> detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for av nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow up or development of total av block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure <EOS>
<SOS> an increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70 84 years and persons aged <NUM> years and older <EOS>
<SOS> information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare <EOS>
<SOS> the berlin aging study was based on a representative age and gender stratified sample n 516 of berlin citizens aged <MOB> years and older <EOS>

<SOS> a first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented <EOS>
<SOS> problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> we analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization <EOS>
<SOS> semi structured interviews of <NUM> patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease <EOS>

<SOS> the sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described <EOS>
<SOS> malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found <EOS>
<SOS> generally four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described diffuse small nodular large nodular and bulky type <EOS>
<SOS> secondary tumor related or inflammatory complications e g dislocation or compression of vessels thoracic inlet syndrome venous thrombosis ileus urinary retention abscess and effusion can be sonographically evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor related complications <EOS>
<SOS> differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and with certain restrictions on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with doppler sonography <EOS>
<SOS> the primary diagnosis has to be established histologically <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation <EOS>
<SOS> tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed <EOS>
<SOS> for the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of posterolateral instabilities additional procedures are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound of the achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue <EOS>
<SOS> different forms of degenerative disease tendinitis peritendinitis or bursitis fibroosteitis and haglund is disease can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases <EOS>
<SOS> congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected <EOS>
<SOS> tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon critical zone <EOS>
<SOS> immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture vulnerable phase <EOS>
<SOS> with sonography lesions of the achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> the german social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services <EOS>
<SOS> the legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision social code book v only in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and therefore is regulated in the context of providing medical services <EOS>
<SOS> the legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment <EOS>
<SOS> due to the variety of medical services quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner <EOS>
<SOS> according to the law providers of medical services doctors hospitals are bound to participate in quality assessment <EOS>
<SOS> as internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization consumers patients or their representatives are not involved in the definition establishment and control of quality assessment <EOS>
<SOS> the participation of patients should be provided by law <EOS>
<SOS> introduction because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary <EOS>
<SOS> material and methods to discuss these aspects the documented data on tapp operations that have been carried out in this department since <NUM> were analyzed <EOS>
<SOS> the results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve <EOS>
<SOS> results a total of <NUM> teaching procedures were performed by <NUM> surgeons with an individual experience of <NUM> operations median <EOS>
<SOS> before starting the first procedure <NUM> were done by assistants operating the camera <EOS>
<SOS> the morbidity of teaching operations was <NUM> compared to <NUM> for those performed by experts <EOS>
<SOS> after a median follow up of <NUM> months there were two recurrences 0 23 in the expert group and none in the teaching group follow up <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion because of the potentials of standardization of the tapp technique the results of teaching were equal to expert operations <EOS>
<SOS> therefore tapp is suitable for application in a routine setting <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure <EOS>
<SOS> this led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years <EOS>
<SOS> to minimize the risk of bleeding we improved the high frequency technology in several steps <EOS>
<SOS> to achieve this the output signals of commercially available high frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding <EOS>
<SOS> as a result blood transfusions were less necessary the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period and hospitalization time was significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the improved high frequency technology in form of the coagulating intermittent cutting results in a blood sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> an accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental self inflicted or the result of a criminal act <EOS>
<SOS> clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem <EOS>
<SOS> we therefore examined <NUM> legal autopsies performed at the institutes of forensic medicine of the universities of würzburg and leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney is offices in an effort to clarify this question <EOS>
<SOS> as a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10 15 min <EOS>
<SOS> however the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer <EOS>
<SOS> the present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication <EOS>
<SOS> androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> however in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential <EOS>
<SOS> by periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved <EOS>
<SOS> apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed <EOS>
<SOS> in how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> during pressure support ventilation psv the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the delivered flow pattern during psv might be better synchronised with the patient is demands than during volume assisted ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> in several modern ventilators inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25 of the initial peak value <EOS>
<SOS> however this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high <EOS>
<SOS> this could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator but also in reduced ventilatory support <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient is inspiratory effort <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak flow rate during psv on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing <EOS>
<SOS> to date positron emission tomography pet is the most powerful tool for the non invasive study of biochemical processes <EOS>
<SOS> besides its usefulness for basic research pet has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications <EOS>
<SOS> however the introduction of pet into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs <EOS>
<SOS> several american studies lend support to the hypothesis that pet may be more cost effective than the conventional diagnostic work up at least for some of its clinical indications <EOS>
<SOS> in germany however this hypothesis has still not been verified <EOS>
<SOS> the rapid growth development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability <EOS>
<SOS> it is well known that early nutrition has short term effects e g <EOS>
<SOS> on growth and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy e g <EOS>
<SOS> hypoglycaemia phenylketonuria have long term effects on child development <EOS>
<SOS> more recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range which occur during sensitive periods of early human development may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood <EOS>
<SOS> this metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood <EOS>
<SOS> long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus crohn is disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants <EOS>
<SOS> an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions <EOS>
<SOS> already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy <EOS>
<SOS> persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases <EOS>
<SOS> an analysis of the reported communicable diseases in germany shows a large number of cases of typhoid fever paratyphoid fever shigella infections trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in germany originated from foreign countries <EOS>
<SOS> intervention measures are necessary above all with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine preventable diseases <EOS>
<SOS> bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3 5 of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about <NUM> cases are reported in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> an even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non germ cell tumor <EOS>
<SOS> we report the 6th case of such a coincidence <EOS>
<SOS> the dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated <EOS>
<SOS> even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered if the strict conditions for resection and follow up are respected <EOS>
<SOS> most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic <EOS>
<SOS> besides the known effects of beta blockers among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk <EOS>
<SOS> reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications <EOS>
<SOS> only augmentation of case numbers by meta analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality <EOS>
<SOS> however the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases <EOS>
<SOS> this and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug <EOS>
<SOS> an additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies <EOS>
<SOS> at present primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at german epilepsy centers of usual pre and postoperative drug treatment the following strategy is recommended <EOS>
<SOS> an ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment <EOS>
<SOS> the specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive and also opens access to the ressources of the past <EOS>
<SOS> in the present study conditions for this access in particular with older people were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> it is assumed that older people especially when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment such as moving to a home are rejected by older people <EOS>
<SOS> these hypotheses were checked on the basis of material n 120 gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> to make matters clear typical and thus every day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material <EOS>
<SOS> finally practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged <EOS>
<SOS> following shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia <NUM> patients were given subcutaneous redon drains while another <NUM> patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial <EOS>
<SOS> the amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis <EOS>
<SOS> the degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score <EOS>
<SOS> inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications <EOS>
<SOS> the drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day 36 0 vs <NUM> ml <EOS>
<SOS> wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group <EOS>
<SOS> seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture <EOS>
<SOS> the drain only slightly affected personal impairment 25 6 vs <NUM> visual analogue score <EOS>
<SOS> body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation 37 2 vs <NUM> <NUM> °c <EOS>
<SOS> we believe there is no indication for the routine use of a redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia <EOS>
<SOS> instead percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of implanted cement spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component the iliac vessels were compressed <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65 year old patient during a revision operation <EOS>
<SOS> we recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis <EOS>
<SOS> for therapy in those cases extra anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies <EOS>
<SOS> one of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints <EOS>
<SOS> such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations <EOS>
<SOS> the pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion <EOS>
<SOS> objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing <EOS>
<SOS> they are not detectable in x ray computertomography or nmr <EOS>
<SOS> in this article we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of fechtner syndrome a condition which consists of hearing loss 49 macrothrombocytopenia 100 leukocyte inclusion bodies 100 eye anomalies 54 3 and nephritis 38 7 <EOS>
<SOS> this article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es <EOS>
<SOS> standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained <EOS>
<SOS> different models of in vitro culture monolayer three dimensional tumor cultures and organ cultures are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue <EOS>
<SOS> two important recent extensions of tissue culture serum free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells are described <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of this prospective randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and or vomiting ponv during the first <NUM> h postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> for a quality assurance study on ponv we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in <NUM> patients undergoing four different types of surgery subtotal thyroidectomy laparotomy for gynaecological procedures laparoscopy and surgery for extra abdominal procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by rolling in should be controlled experimentally <EOS>
<SOS> five segments of human femoral popliteal artery 3 4 cm long were overstretched until complete rupture occured <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured <EOS>
<SOS> as morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture <EOS>
<SOS> this phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a chinese finger trap <EOS>
<SOS> in the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued <EOS>
<SOS> neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for rolling in of intima or media layer <EOS>
<SOS> the reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than rolling in of intima or media layer <EOS>
<SOS> if there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected <EOS>
<SOS> time and again a lack of staff in the field of people is nursing is discussed chronic lack of nursing staff this means that there are not enough people to do the available work 1 <EOS>
<SOS> however the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people is stationary care <EOS>
<SOS> first of all this article points out the time dimension throughout life <EOS>
<SOS> this is followed by people is varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings <EOS>
<SOS> hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent <EOS>
<SOS> the old people is awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes <EOS>
<SOS> intravascular ultrasound ivus has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology <EOS>
<SOS> the main reason is the capability to obtain in vivo micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo transducers with an outer diameter of <MOB> french <EOS>
<SOS> for the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment <EOS>
<SOS> the capabilities of ivus can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic strength of ivus is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis to assess intermediate lesions to reveal occult left main stem disease and angiographically silent arteriosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> in conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve patients with the diagnosis of coronary syndrome x can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> additionally ivus is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the aha acc stary classification <EOS>
<SOS> introduction the chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen <EOS>
<SOS> there is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity <EOS>
<SOS> however there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> in a retrospective study on <NUM> patients 15 girls and <NUM> boys the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically <EOS>
<SOS> only patients with a minimum age of <NUM> years and with at least <NUM> year of postoperative follow up were included <EOS>
<SOS> the radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims as projected in postero anterior cephalograms <EOS>
<SOS> according to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72 7 of our patients <EOS>
<SOS> there was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient age at surgery or the amount of advancement <EOS>
<SOS> with the exception of severe cases of crouzon is disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto orbital correction <EOS>
<SOS> failures after ankle arthrodesis are according to the literature and our own experience more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods <EOS>
<SOS> favourable results can be obtained with the standard four screw technique preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non union in <NUM> own cases with this technique <EOS>
<SOS> a vital x ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic x ray <EOS>
<SOS> due to its variety of special projections including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings <EOS>
<SOS> it has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices as well as of x ray films and by new detection systems such as sensors or screens <EOS>
<SOS> in some clinical cases the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance mr imaging indispensable <EOS>
<SOS> although mr is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times <EOS>
<SOS> in certain cases e g changes to bone metabolism differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image aided analysis of function possible <EOS>
<SOS> secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than <NUM> of patients with salmonella infections <EOS>
<SOS> these atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre existing local or systemic disease <EOS>
<SOS> we present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head <EOS>
<SOS> histologic analysis showed signs of pre existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake <EOS>
<SOS> cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue <EOS>
<SOS> initially a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour <EOS>
<SOS> the onset clinical course diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature <EOS>
<SOS> this case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist <EOS>
<SOS> there are two types of diabetes mellitus <EOS>
<SOS> type i insulin dependent diabetes iddm which becomes manifest before the age of 40 is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin <EOS>
<SOS> type ii the non insulin dependent diabetes niddm develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> patients with type i diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis while type ii causes hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma <EOS>
<SOS> apart from these acute metabolic alterations the long term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist <EOS>
<SOS> hypertension coronary artery disease renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis with an increased risk of aspiration <EOS>
<SOS> limited movement of the atlanto occipital joint can cause difficult intubation <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy blood glucose concentration should be kept between <NUM> and <NUM> mmol l 1 120 <NUM> mg dl 1 <EOS>
<SOS> hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain <EOS>
<SOS> perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> all type i diabetics whatever operation being performed need insulin <EOS>
<SOS> the intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment <EOS>
<SOS> after determination of the fasting blood glucose level insulin is given at a dosage of <NUM> <NUM> u h 1 at gluc11 1 mmol l 1 <NUM> <NUM> u h 1 at gluc <NUM> <NUM> mmol l 1 or <NUM> <NUM> u h 1 at gluc16 7 mmol l 1 <EOS>
<SOS> in addition <NUM> <NUM> g glucose h 1 is given <EOS>
<SOS> in type ii diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld <EOS>
<SOS> during minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently and if necessary insulin with gluc13 9 mmol l 1 or glucose is given <EOS>
<SOS> in most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary <EOS>
<SOS> administration should follow the guidelines listed for type i diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin repeated glucose determinations are mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> if ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline <EOS>
<SOS> for hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin 3 <NUM> u h 1 with <NUM> <NUM> mmol h 1 potassium phosphate is given <EOS>
<SOS> bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum ph is lower than <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> it must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care <EOS>
<SOS> at the beginning of the <NUM> th century institutional care for the insane was established by the various german states <EOS>
<SOS> at first the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of care and cure in one hospital in illenau was a turning point in institutional care <EOS>
<SOS> contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the <NUM> th century the integration with general medicine in the cities on the one hand the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside on the other <EOS>
<SOS> the characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects <EOS>
<SOS> the following building styles were dominant in england panoptic architecture in the united states linear staggered structures in france the carrés isolés and in germany the structure of blocks with cross axes <EOS>
<SOS> at the end of the <NUM> th century the system of pavilions was internationally accepted occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced <EOS>
<SOS> from the first world war until the end of the <NUM> s a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in germany and institutional care came under increasing criticism <EOS>
<SOS> there was a reorientation from the middle of the <NUM> s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities <EOS>
<SOS> a variety of complementary institutions outpatient and partly inpatient therapies which were recommended by the psychiatrie enquête started to be realized <EOS>
<SOS> smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals as did the integration into the community and the city <EOS>
<SOS> principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room or grading the rooms from public to private were structurally integrated <EOS>
<SOS> specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post occupancy methods <EOS>
<SOS> the coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures <EOS>
<SOS> it allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting <EOS>
<SOS> by this method primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced <EOS>
<SOS> all trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re examined to check functional and aesthetic results <EOS>
<SOS> the complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended <EOS>
<SOS> one case of a newly described rare odontogenic tumor is reported <EOS>
<SOS> a literature review of <NUM> cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability both regionally and distantly of the clear cell odontogenic tumor <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that this tumor is malignant with a tendency to recur locally after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> it requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> in our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma both with regional lymph node metastasis <EOS>
<SOS> the histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult <EOS>
<SOS> as the elderly segment of our population expands there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group <EOS>
<SOS> the elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients <EOS>
<SOS> increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic resistant organisms <EOS>
<SOS> this article focuses on the epidemiological considerations risk factors types of infections that occur in elderly patients and the guidelines for empiric therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection and skin and soft tissue infection <EOS>
<SOS> empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification age medical illnesses and severity of presentation <EOS>
<SOS> many additional aspects e g route of administration drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics drug toxicity and drug drug interactions compliance and multiple underlying diseases e g renal failure must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen <EOS>
<SOS> we present long term results minimum follow up <NUM> years in <NUM> patients with advanced non seminomatous germ cell tumours who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy rpla after chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> we correlated patients outcomes death of disease to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings <EOS>

<SOS> the ned rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy dod <NUM> we determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome <EOS>
<SOS> follow up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates <EOS>
<SOS> we sought to determine if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated long term angiographic outcome of <NUM> stent implantations performed in <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> multivariate analysis correlated clinical procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis 50 at follow up <EOS>
<SOS> angiographic restenosis was observed in 34 of lesions treated <EOS>

<SOS> critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches <EOS>
<SOS> to compare the conventional 2 d the simulator guided semi 3 d and the recently developed ct guided 3 d brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with t1 2 n0 1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery <EOS>
<SOS> fifty two of them received boost brachytherapy after <NUM> to <NUM> gy teletherapy and <NUM> patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes <EOS>
<SOS> single double and triple plane implant was used in 6 <NUM> and <NUM> cases respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was <NUM> times <NUM> gy and <NUM> times <NUM> gy respectively <EOS>
<SOS> the positions of dose reference points varied according to the level 2 d semi 3 d and 3 d of treatment planning performed <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment planning was based on the 3 d reconstruction of the surgical clips implant tubes and skin points <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases the implantations were planned with a semi 3 d technique aided by simulator <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases a recently developed ct guided 3 d planning system was used <EOS>
<SOS> the semi 3 d and 3 d treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2 d plans using dose volume histograms and dose non uniformity ratios <EOS>
<SOS> the values of mean central dose mean skin dose minimal clip dose proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> the accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique <EOS>
<SOS> with the help of conformal semi 3 d and 3 d brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points active source positions and dwell times individually <EOS>
<SOS> this technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22 2 and reduced the possibility of geographical miss <EOS>
<SOS> we could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the ct image based 3 d treatment planning at the cost of worse dose homogeneity <EOS>
<SOS> the mean treated volume was reduced by 25 1 with semi 3 d planning however it was increased by 16 2 with 3 d planning compared to the 2 d planning <EOS>
<SOS> the application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal semi 3 d and 3 d planning help to avoid geographical miss <EOS>
<SOS> ct is suitable for 3 d brachytherapy planning <EOS>
<SOS> better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques <EOS>
<SOS> conformal 3 d brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts taking the irregular 3 d shape of the target volume into account <EOS>
<SOS> the routine clinical application of image based 3 d brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future <EOS>
<SOS> background staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found <EOS>
<SOS> according to valenton und okumoto with this staphylococci associated blepharo kerato conjunctivitis in culture positive cases s aureus is found in 31 and s epidermidis in 69 of smears <EOS>
<SOS> microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology <EOS>
<SOS> multiple organ failure mof may occur early or late after trauma <EOS>
<SOS> besides direct physical injury of organs compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mof <EOS>
<SOS> inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis <EOS>
<SOS> as a result infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of mof <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic mof there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states <EOS>
<SOS> early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function gut injury hypothesis and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients <EOS>
<SOS> nineteen severely injured patients injury severity score 40 3 11 6 were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube <EOS>
<SOS> despite maxillary fractures rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma <EOS>
<SOS> intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within <NUM> or <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases a central venous line was always additionally necessary <EOS>
<SOS> however the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut <EOS>
<SOS> the study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients <EOS>
<SOS> the expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified <EOS>
<SOS> enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed <EOS>
<SOS> definition of the problem the rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain dead pregnant women since the 1980 s <EOS>
<SOS> the discussion today revolves around medical social legal and economic aspects <EOS>
<SOS> the historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers usually by means of a sectio in mortua nowadays known as a perimortem caesarean section and their significance in today is debate are for the most part regarded as being of little relevance <EOS>
<SOS> pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients especially in aids cases <EOS>
<SOS> the present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign body reaction in a patient with successfully treated pcp who was known to have aids <EOS>
<SOS> this form of residues of completely healed pcp tends to be rare <EOS>
<SOS> other infectious granulomas foreign body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> after cautious decalcification pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver grocott <EOS>
<SOS> it is important to be aware that pcp can also undergo spontaneous cure so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of aids <EOS>
<SOS> background in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency high pre and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls <EOS>
<SOS> methods in order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality of life study <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients 45 and their mothers 35 covering difficulties and problems in general most aspects of their medical histology self image body image and current life with or without a male or female partner <EOS>
<SOS> results the patients were socially competent with a well developed social network <EOS>
<SOS> however regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant <EOS>
<SOS> these resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married <EOS>
<SOS> existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of homosexuality was not increased <EOS>
<SOS> the number of women having children was significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> a substantial number of women suffered from androgen dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism <EOS>
<SOS> mothers and patients denied any sex specific eduction but the girls had preferred boy specific toys and competitive outdoor games <EOS>
<SOS> however school performance was average and comparable to the controls <EOS>
<SOS> most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth <EOS>
<SOS> even though they felt they had received good medical treatment mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions it seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease <EOS>
<SOS> problems regarding partnership sexuality and fertility remain and have to be addressed <EOS>
<SOS> introduction orthotopic liver transplantation olt has become an accepted treatment for end stage liver disease <EOS>
<SOS> however postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality <EOS>
<SOS> early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance <EOS>
<SOS> materials and methods we retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent olt at our institution <EOS>
<SOS> duplex doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver <EOS>
<SOS> other important techniques were ct mri and angiography which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications <EOS>
<SOS> results second to primary organ dysfunction vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss <EOS>
<SOS> thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication with a reported incidence from <NUM> to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> bile duct sludge leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation which can contribute to graft dysfunction <EOS>
<SOS> biliary tract complications usually occur within the first <NUM> months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy they are at increased risk of developing late post transplant malignancies which are best depicted by us ct or mri <EOS>
<SOS> however radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion cholangiography and duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with olt <EOS>
<SOS> ct mri and angiography are problem solving tools in equivocal cases <EOS>
<SOS> recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about <NUM> of the cases with localized neoplasia <EOS>
<SOS> it is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional peripheral blood or bone marrow <EOS>
<SOS> we developed a procedure to detect non visible abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti tumor cell antibody injected before the operation radioimmunoguided surgery rigs <EOS>
<SOS> however even with the best technique it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens <EOS>
<SOS> based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens taa we developed a new method to reduce and correct the b cell response and b cell recruitment due to chronic taa immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells immune corrective surgery ics <EOS>
<SOS> this method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the target lymph nodes were those loaded with taa immune complex <EOS>
<SOS> the detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> patients stage i ii and ii treated with ics <NUM> survived more than <NUM> years showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases and more importantly correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the t cell response against residual tumor cells <EOS>
<SOS> knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal <EOS>
<SOS> for this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar arterial po2 difference is helpful <EOS>
<SOS> pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation perfusion v a q <EOS>
<SOS> in daily practice venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed venous blood <EOS>
<SOS> by analysing arterial and expired pco2 dead space ventilation can be determined but extended analyses of v a q <EOS>
<SOS> distribution are not possible in daily practice <EOS>
<SOS> however knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes <EOS>
<SOS> background infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a <NUM> year old man with acatalasemia is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the congenital disorder <NUM> is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water <EOS>
<SOS> the defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion <EOS>
<SOS> occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or takahara is disease <EOS>
<SOS> poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we decided to re investigate our group of <NUM> patients who were operated on between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> all patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow <NUM> ml min as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography <EOS>
<SOS> these patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis <EOS>
<SOS> an up to date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients were available here for long term follow up <EOS>
<SOS> we divided the findings into three groups complete spontaneous erection postoperative response to cavernous auto injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the short term success rate for these groups after 1 3 months was an outcome of <NUM> 24 6 <NUM> 19 8 and <NUM> 55 6 patients <NUM> of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year p k 0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of k <NUM> years a normal cc emg and a maintenance flow of k <NUM> ml min <EOS>
<SOS> if all three parameters were present the long term success rate spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection of <NUM> of all patients was found to rise to <NUM> in this selected group of patients p k 0 001 <EOS>
<SOS> this study reveals that long term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing however careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long term results <EOS>
<SOS> pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems <EOS>
<SOS> high dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice <EOS>
<SOS> however recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives <EOS>
<SOS> pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine a <EOS>
<SOS> because of side effects and drug interactions the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored <EOS>
<SOS> six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies were treated with oral cyclosporine a at mean daily doses of approximately <NUM> mg kg <EOS>
<SOS> marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3 6 months <EOS>
<SOS> only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment <EOS>
<SOS> no severe irreversible side effects occurred <EOS>
<SOS> the results show that low dose cyclosporine a treatment can be considered a first line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum <EOS>
<SOS> medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non governmental organisations in crisis areas and out of area operations by troops and also national disasters require special trauma management <EOS>
<SOS> deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long distance medical evacuation the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries <EOS>
<SOS> massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines aggressive wound débridement is often needed <EOS>
<SOS> timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad spectrum antibiotic with a long half life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds <EOS>
<SOS> suitable antibiotics for these indications are piperacillin tazobactam and ceftriazon <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement <EOS>
<SOS> craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth <EOS>
<SOS> the patient population consisted of <NUM> children the postoperative follow up time in <NUM> patients was more than <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> of the children followed up <NUM> were male and <NUM> female <EOS>
<SOS> thirty six cases involved untreated non syndromic craniosynostosis the remaining <NUM> were syndrome cases <EOS>
<SOS> the patient ages ranged from <NUM> to <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> the fronto occipital circumference was registered in accordance with prader is percentile table <EOS>
<SOS> the operative method included a fronto parietal craniotomy the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto orbital band and a vault cranioplasty <EOS>
<SOS> during follow up <NUM> patients treated with fronto orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed <NUM> patient changed to a higher curve <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of syndromic craniosynostosis <NUM> patients remained in the post operatively registered percentile curve <NUM> patients changed to a lower and <NUM> patient to a higher percentile curve <EOS>
<SOS> no growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed <EOS>
<SOS> no significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis <EOS>
<SOS> today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques <EOS>
<SOS> the retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach <EOS>
<SOS> the correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries <EOS>
<SOS> the overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope which is furthermore positioned very close to the operative field <EOS>
<SOS> it is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation <EOS>
<SOS> the decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined <EOS>
<SOS> lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age related retinal degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> it is known that lipid peroxides can oxidize benzidine <EOS>
<SOS> this property was used to localize lipid peroxides ultrastructurally in the retina <EOS>
<SOS> in a <NUM> year old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm renal artery stenosis and coronary artery disease an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a jostenttm peripheral stent graft <EOS>
<SOS> angiographic follow up after <NUM> and <NUM> months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> intravascular ultrasound showed no neo intimal hyperplasia within the stent <EOS>
<SOS> a computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm <EOS>
<SOS> based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in ra patients new therapeutic principles have been developed aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines <EOS>
<SOS> both principles however have proven to be very effective <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable followed by a first very carefully formulated protocol for human ra <EOS>
<SOS> gene therapy for ra has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to ra patients <EOS>
<SOS> several problems such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved <EOS>
<SOS> with more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like ra in the coming years <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of typical whiplash after low energy rear end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits <EOS>
<SOS> patients with bony and discoligamentous lesions have to be excluded as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits <EOS>
<SOS> a therapeutic rationale is the basis of full neuromuscular recovery ad integrum <EOS>
<SOS> the news of success in ether anesthesia on <NUM> october <NUM> in boston spread like wildfire through europe <EOS>
<SOS> in the german speaking countries the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role this was especially the case for the augsburger allgemeine zeitung whose correspondent aloys martin 1 was a medical professional <EOS>
<SOS> the function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated <EOS>
<SOS> this was to be remedied by examining both of bamberg is local papers <EOS>
<SOS> all issues from <MOB> to <URL> were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements <EOS>
<SOS> these were then catalogued according to date extent and contents <EOS>
<SOS> starting on <URL> the events outside of and in bamberg were reported on in <NUM> notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements aloys martin also appears on the scene <EOS>
<SOS> thus the local press in bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events <EOS>
<SOS> true arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding <EOS>
<SOS> during surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the special features of diagnosis histology and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries <EOS>
<SOS> we recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications <EOS>
<SOS> dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems <EOS>
<SOS> dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people <EOS>

<SOS> additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas duboisii is endemic in central and south africa <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence of scientific advances an increasing number of patients with advanced age reduced myocardial performance previous cardiac surgery comorbidities and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery <EOS>
<SOS> this requires risk stratification to predict low moderate and high operative risk <EOS>
<SOS> risk factors can be divided into pre intra and postoperative patient structure and procedure related <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of this risk prediction the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management <EOS>
<SOS> unnoticed minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia <EOS>
<SOS> the damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it <EOS>
<SOS> we report one case of a potential life threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction modified machine check procedures or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine check procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment so called borderline damage may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer <EOS>
<SOS> most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non functional <EOS>
<SOS> in reality this is not the case <EOS>
<SOS> intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine check procedures <EOS>
<SOS> this problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients <EOS>
<SOS> because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist <EOS>

<SOS> nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days <EOS>
<SOS> this is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to <NUM> years ago <EOS>
<SOS> today nonunions of the malleoli are seen if at all is infected cases after surgical procedures <EOS>
<SOS> noninfected stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction <EOS>
<SOS> in painful cases small fragments especially of the medial malleolus should be resected larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3 5 mm cancellous screws <EOS>
<SOS> alternatively the tension banding technique especially after weber a fracture produces high compression in the area of nonunion <EOS>
<SOS> in cases of additional bony defects a local upside down cortical cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition <EOS>
<SOS> in summary the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling bone grafting and stabilization <EOS>
<SOS> infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy <EOS>
<SOS> this study investigated the influence of the patients educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> we considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in germany <EOS>
<SOS> data were collected from the therapists case history n 274 submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies <EOS>
<SOS> we found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> in our sample 43 5 had graduated from senior high school compared with 25 1 in the average german population <EOS>
<SOS> this relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis <EOS>
<SOS> 51 7 of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13 2 from junior high school compared with 48 7 in the average german population <EOS>
<SOS> also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education not on gender age or type of statutory health insurance <EOS>
<SOS> these results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced <EOS>
<SOS> after the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks <EOS>
<SOS> thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated <EOS>
<SOS> with the holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation what you see is what you get <EOS>
<SOS> the postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after tur p <EOS>
<SOS> the classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs <EOS>
<SOS> the introduction of spiral ct with multiplanar reformations and 3 d views has improved the quality of visualization <EOS>
<SOS> due to their higher costs the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned <EOS>
<SOS> this paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs 2 d cts 3 d cts and femursubtraction cts fsct for the classification of acetabular fractures based on a controlled study <EOS>
<SOS> methods thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of <NUM> each group i comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery group ii was physicians with 3 10 years of operative experience and group ii was experts in acetabular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics plain radiographs 2 d ct ct with multiplanar reformation 3 d ct fs ct of different acetabular fracture types were prepared <EOS>
<SOS> the task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint e g marginal impaction head fractures etc <EOS>
<SOS> the different diagnostic levels could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given <EOS>
<SOS> the case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the use of the different radiographs the preliminary diagnosis the changes in diagnosis and the final decisions were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> these findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a consensus classification which was generated by thorough discussion and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates <EOS>
<SOS> results the correct fracture classification based on plain radiographs was group i <NUM> group ii <NUM> group ii <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> based on 2 d ct a correct diagnosis was reached by <NUM> in group i by <NUM> in group ii and by <NUM> in group ii <EOS>
<SOS> with consideration of the transient forms in acetabular fractures based on letournel and the 3 d ct used mainly by group i the rate of correct classifications rose to <NUM> in group i <NUM> in group ii and <NUM> in group ii <EOS>
<SOS> the modifiers were diagnosed correctly in group i by <NUM> in group ii by <NUM> and in group ii by <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the use of the 3 d ct and especially the fs ct by group i resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to <NUM> whereas in group ii the fs ct was used only exceptionally <EOS>
<SOS> the 2 d ct was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in <NUM> complete diagnoses in group ii <EOS>
<SOS> this study showed the importance of ct for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures <EOS>
<SOS> in particular the secondary reformations in ct and the 3 d views dramatically improved the rate of correct classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery <EOS>
<SOS> this allows the less experienced an acceptable level of correct diagnoses so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly <EOS>
<SOS> among the experts a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately <NUM> was observed especially in transient forms of acetabular fractures <EOS>

<SOS> cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators <EOS>
<SOS> transcranial doppler tcd may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short and long term effects of desobliteration <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and <NUM> were re evaluated <NUM> year later <EOS>
<SOS> the preoperative vasomotor capacity using tcd with co2 was 57 <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere and <NUM> year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102 80 <EOS>
<SOS> one year later patients with unilateral stenosis n 11 presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65 46 after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51 35 to 48 38 <EOS>
<SOS> patients with bilateral stenoses n 9 demonstrated an initial decrease from 70 60 to 48 21 and a significant rise to 115 77 <NUM> year later p 0 02 <EOS>
<SOS> both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase irrespective of the symptomatology <EOS>
<SOS> chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups slow transit constipation caused by pathological intestinal transit and obstructive defecation disorder caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities <EOS>
<SOS> videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum <EOS>
<SOS> videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation <EOS>
<SOS> defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures <EOS>
<SOS> within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in <NUM> patients with slow transit and <NUM> patients with obstructive disease <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with slow transit both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder slow transit defecoflowmetry <NUM> videodefecography <NUM> obstructive defecation disorder <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation with a range of 43 55 s rectoceles are demonstrated in <NUM> of cases with slow transit and in <NUM> with obstructive defecation disorder <EOS>
<SOS> also we often found obstructive components in slow transit constipation patients <EOS>
<SOS> normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation <EOS>
<SOS> absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain <EOS>

<SOS> echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed <EOS>
<SOS> investigations the heart rate in the ecg was arrhythmic at 146 min intermittently sinus rhythm was established <EOS>
<SOS> transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria <EOS>
<SOS> the chest x ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border <EOS>
<SOS> computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses hence the difference between an intra cardiac tumour i e <EOS>
<SOS> myxoma and a tumour of extracardiac mediastinal origin could not be established <EOS>
<SOS> additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium <EOS>
<SOS> therapy for certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy <EOS>
<SOS> histologically a dysontogenetic benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed <EOS>

<SOS> grip strength improved to 60 of the opposite side <EOS>
<SOS> active range of motion reached 50 of the contralateral wrist <EOS>
<SOS> nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis <EOS>
<SOS> 80 of the patients returned to their original occupation <EOS>
<SOS> midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed <EOS>
<SOS> the dash score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility <EOS>
<SOS> total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense <EOS>
<SOS> stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes accounting for up to <NUM> of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics <EOS>
<SOS> runners are particularly prone to these injuries however it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete is biomechanical predisposition training methods and other factors such as diet and muscle strength and flexibility <EOS>
<SOS> this article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice <EOS>
<SOS> a classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury <EOS>
<SOS> today enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible <EOS>
<SOS> however there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity and placebo controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy <EOS>
<SOS> the documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma resulting in pain reduction and better mobility <EOS>
<SOS> there are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery traumatology plastic surgery and dental surgery <EOS>
<SOS> a further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes <EOS>
<SOS> in gynaecological treatments enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries <EOS>
<SOS> breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy <EOS>
<SOS> further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits <EOS>
<SOS> high frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent among others two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates <EOS>

<SOS> at an oxygenation index of <NUM> we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right to left shunting and improve oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> how ever the respiratory situation did not improve the oxygenation index increased to <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> after discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to hfv with mean airway pressures of <NUM> mbar <EOS>
<SOS> again oxyena tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> at that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of <NUM> ppm while continuing high frequency ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> immediately oxygenation improved significantly the oxygenation index decreased to <NUM> within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide <EOS>
<SOS> this effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from ino could be performed <EOS>
<SOS> learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones <EOS>
<SOS> ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult <EOS>
<SOS> due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible <EOS>
<SOS> rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one <EOS>
<SOS> by using ct scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3d pictures on a cad workstation <EOS>
<SOS> we are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone <EOS>
<SOS> it is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object <EOS>
<SOS> with this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching training and research <EOS>
<SOS> our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out <EOS>
<SOS> during the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities especially during the first phase <EOS>
<SOS> numerous controlled studies and meta analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease modifying drugs with regard to efficacy and side effects <EOS>
<SOS> during the first stage of these disease the immunobiological substances against pro inflammatory cells are employed <EOS>
<SOS> improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment correct diet and careful observation of the patient is progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality <EOS>
<SOS> intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure peepi occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance tubes valves etc <EOS>
<SOS> it is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was the validation of an automated peepi determination method implemented in the respirator evita drägerwerke lübeck in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure <EOS>
<SOS> the method was validated in ten sedated myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies five with restrictive and five with obstructive pulmonary disease <EOS>
<SOS> peepi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at zeep or at an external peep of <NUM> as well as <NUM> cm h2o <EOS>
<SOS> peepi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the evita five measurements at each end expiratory pressure level peepevita <EOS>
<SOS> steady state was attained between each measurement <EOS>
<SOS> these values were compared to the results obtained with end expiratory occlusion external computer controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit at the respective pressure levels peepeeo <EOS>
<SOS> the average of five measurements at each peep level with each method was defined as peepi for the particular ventilatory situation <EOS>
<SOS> gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer fleisch no <EOS>
<SOS> 2 fleisch lausanne switzerland and a differential pressure transducer <EOS>
<SOS> tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer dr fenyves gut basel switzerland <EOS>
<SOS> after a d conversion data were sampled with a frequency of <NUM> hz and processed on an ibm compatible pc <EOS>
<SOS> software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self programmed <EOS>
<SOS> for the statistical analysis we used the mann whitney u test or wilcoxon signed ranks test a p value less than <NUM> was considered significant <EOS>
<SOS> at the given respiratory setting and without peep patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher peepi median <NUM> cm h2o range <NUM> <NUM> cm h2o than those with restrictive pulmonary disease median <NUM> cm h2o range <NUM> <NUM> cm h2o p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> increasing external peep to <NUM> or <NUM> cm h2o significantly decreased the pressure difference between peepi and external peep p0 05 but was unable to eliminate it completely <EOS>
<SOS> there was no statistically significant difference between peepeeo and peepevita p 0 43 wilcoxon signed ranks tests <EOS>
<SOS> regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between peepeeo and peepevita values r 0 985 p0 001 y 1 03x 0 18 <EOS>
<SOS> peepi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease <EOS>
<SOS> the difference between external end expiratory pressure and peepi decreases with increasing external peep <EOS>
<SOS> however peepi may increase with increasing external peep in some instances <EOS>
<SOS> the reason for this may be that the peepi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different peepi values of various lung regions <EOS>
<SOS> increasing external peep only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on peepi values lower than external peep <EOS>
<SOS> the peepi values measured by the evita respirator compared with classical end expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical <EOS>
<SOS> unfortunately peepi measurement of the evita can only <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the case of a 70 year old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye <EOS>
<SOS> this rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular nuchal and sternal <EOS>
<SOS> because of the patient is cardio pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia <EOS>

<SOS> ondansetron a selective 5 ht3 receptor antagonist has recently been shown in a dose of <NUM> mg to be superior to <NUM> mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting <EOS>
<SOS> there are indications that a dose of <NUM> mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of <NUM> mg 16 <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of <NUM> mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil <EOS>
<SOS> following institutional approval <NUM> asa physical status i and ii women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized double blind comparative study <EOS>
<SOS> five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia <NUM> patients received a single intravenous iv dose of <NUM> mg of ondansetron and the remaining <NUM> received <NUM> mg droperidol iv <EOS>
<SOS> anaesthesia was induced with <NUM> <NUM> mg kg of thiopental and <NUM> mg of alfentanil iv and maintained with 65 nitrous oxide and 1 5 3 enflurane in oxygen <EOS>
<SOS> on pain stimuli another <NUM> <NUM> mg of alfentanil was given <EOS>
<SOS> total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for <NUM> h postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of nausea vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and p0 05 was considered significant <EOS>
<SOS> patients were similar with respect to age height body weight and total anaesthetic agents received <EOS>

<SOS> hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid <EOS>
<SOS> according to who recommendations hydromorphone is to be classified in step ii of pain therapy <EOS>
<SOS> an oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of <NUM> hours has been evaluated only recently <EOS>
<SOS> the controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain <EOS>
<SOS> the oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step ii <EOS>
<SOS> hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief despite increase of doses or causes intolerable side effects despite treatment of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> in principle no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected <EOS>
<SOS> however clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects <EOS>
<SOS> the dose of hydromorphone equivalent to <NUM> times <NUM> mg controlled release morphine is about <NUM> times <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> the values for the absorption bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every <NUM> hours of three times the dose are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every <NUM> hours <EOS>
<SOS> in several open label and controlled studies hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain especially in patients with severe cancer pain <EOS>
<SOS> with regard to the incidence of side effects no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established <EOS>
<SOS> in general the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients <NUM> elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed <EOS>
<SOS> as augmentation materials autografts from the iliac crest combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in <NUM> sinus lifts were transplanted in <NUM> cases and osteoinductive allogeneic bone powder aa bone autolyzed antigen extracted allogeneic bone n 8 dfdba demineralized freeze dried bone allograft and or graftontm demineralized bone matrix gel n 35 were used in <NUM> cases <EOS>
<SOS> some 4 6 months after implantation osteoinductive allogeneic demineralized bone implants showed radio opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation <EOS>
<SOS> histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients own bone tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was <NUM> <NUM> 3 mm in comparison with <NUM> <NUM> 3 mm after allograft implantations <EOS>
<SOS> histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials <EOS>
<SOS> endoscopic controls showed in both groups nonirritated mucous membranes <EOS>
<SOS> on an average <NUM> endosseous implants bone lockr or itir screw implants were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> no osseointegration was achieved in <NUM> out of <NUM> dental implants when bone autografts were used and in <NUM> out of <NUM> dental implants of the allogeneic bone group <EOS>
<SOS> patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of <NUM> <NUM> 9 days without consideration of <NUM> patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for <NUM> <NUM> 5 days <EOS>
<SOS> the <NUM> patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom free several hours after the operation <EOS>
<SOS> under critical consideration of all investigated parameters osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma <EOS>
<SOS> in the literature available only six clinical cases have been reported <EOS>
<SOS> a 64 year old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> histological examination after nephrectomy however revealed a plasmacytoma <EOS>
<SOS> based on this case we discuss how one should proceed in this disease <EOS>
<SOS> primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or bence jones proteinuria as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma <EOS>
<SOS> nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur <EOS>

<SOS> between december <NUM> and november 1995 <NUM> patients with <NUM> acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the department of traumatology and emergency surgery of the university hospitals of the catholic university of leuven <EOS>
<SOS> indications for surgery were unstable fracture displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra acetabular fracture fragments <EOS>
<SOS> there were 37 3 a fractures 49 7 b fractures and 13 c fractures according to the ao classification <EOS>
<SOS> in 16 4 of fractures there were primary neurological deficits <EOS>
<SOS> patients were treated operatively after an average of <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> the kocher langenbeck approach was used in 56 9 of cases the ilio inguinal approach in 27 1 and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4 <EOS>
<SOS> in 7 1 of patients a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted <EOS>
<SOS> there was no intra oder perioperative mortality <EOS>
<SOS> the average hospital stay was <NUM> days <EOS>
<SOS> in 7 1 of patients we noted secondary neurological problems <EOS>
<SOS> deep infections were present in 1 3 <EOS>
<SOS> in 11 1 of patients a second operative procedure was necessary <EOS>
<SOS> we were able to review <NUM> patients after an average of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x rays walking distance hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination <EOS>
<SOS> in 76 of patients an excellent or good result on the merle d aubigne scale was obtained <EOS>
<SOS> t fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results <EOS>
<SOS> during this 9 year period changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification <EOS>
<SOS> after thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches <EOS>
<SOS> because the fractures are relatively rare their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant with consequences for treatment and prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia metaplastic warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy <EOS>
<SOS> the proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes <EOS>
<SOS> in these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases e g <EOS>
<SOS> nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> the initial stage of malignant malt lymphomas in association with sjögren is syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail <EOS>
<SOS> a 59 year old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism <EOS>
<SOS> a second operation and x ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor <EOS>
<SOS> both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas <EOS>
<SOS> immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and fsh in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor <EOS>
<SOS> two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated <EOS>
<SOS> a tumor in the liver was identified <EOS>
<SOS> biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology <EOS>
<SOS> due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism <EOS>
<SOS> post mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin secreting pituitary carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> only six similar cases have been reported in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> our case report confirms the experience with <NUM> definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor but only from its metastases <EOS>
<SOS> paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease <EOS>
<SOS> while some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy obligative marker most only occasionally do so facultative marker <EOS>
<SOS> the association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial <EOS>
<SOS> there are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> we diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a <NUM> year old female patient admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid <EOS>

<SOS> the patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared <EOS>
<SOS> acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury <EOS>
<SOS> the multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur <EOS>
<SOS> fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient <EOS>
<SOS> sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury <EOS>
<SOS> during the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma <EOS>
<SOS> no direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> the tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient <EOS>
<SOS> tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign <EOS>
<SOS> frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients <EOS>
<SOS> we suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy <EOS>
<SOS> aim the long term effect of dnase with cystic fibrosis was examined <EOS>
<SOS> teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers <EOS>
<SOS> the police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media <EOS>
<SOS> using their records such as x rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification <EOS>
<SOS> to evaluate the efficency of this procedure <NUM> cases published between <NUM> and <NUM> were examined <EOS>
<SOS> only 3 of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media <EOS>
<SOS> to improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media <NUM> dentists were asked to take part in a survey <EOS>
<SOS> according to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method <EOS>

<SOS> on the other hand the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to <NUM> times higher <EOS>
<SOS> as a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver <EOS>
<SOS> the intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death <EOS>
<SOS> background despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty dlkp is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty pkp this procedure is rarely performed <EOS>

<SOS> palmoplantar keratodermia ppk varians and ppk punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas <EOS>
<SOS> keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata <EOS>
<SOS> we describe a 31 year old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases <EOS>
<SOS> in view of the co occurrence of these two types of ppk the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect <EOS>

<SOS> with reference to current studies on emigration which for germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between <NUM> and 1938 the immigration policy especially of the united states and great britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in this context the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized <EOS>
<SOS> acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children and add <NUM> own cases of this rare disease <EOS>
<SOS> in the first case diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid <EOS>
<SOS> operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then <EOS>
<SOS> in the second case a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only <EOS>
<SOS> seven years later no recurrent abscess occurred in this child <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection <EOS>

<SOS> only a few days later e c j <EOS>
<SOS> von siebold 1801 in würzburg dagger1861 in göttingen performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics <EOS>
<SOS> following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients <EOS>
<SOS> the first administration was on february 25th <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> while he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new born he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients <EOS>
<SOS> he concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery since it disturbed the natural course of labour <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand von siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention <EOS>
<SOS> background mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> this allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from av synchronous pacing <URL> and method beat to beat mode switching in diamond and clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns <EOS>
<SOS> atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm <EOS>
<SOS> a too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat to beat acceleration <NUM> bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia <EOS>
<SOS> mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor qt interval and activity <EOS>
<SOS> atrial pacing restores av synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia effectively avoiding retrograde conduction <EOS>
<SOS> dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset <EOS>
<SOS> both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic rendering follow up procedures easy and less time consuming <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity <EOS>
<SOS> introduction mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by ct and mri <EOS>
<SOS> the applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air and bone containing thorax which permits only restricted echo windows <EOS>
<SOS> transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum <EOS>
<SOS> blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral effects of hyper or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr are less well known <EOS>
<SOS> in addition little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre cardiac arrest hypo or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics cerebral blood flow cbf and metabolism cmro2 and regional cardiac blood flow during cpr subsequent to <NUM> min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation <EOS>
<SOS> after approval by the state animal investigation committee <NUM> mechanically ventilated anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique <EOS>
<SOS> the animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups in group i n 9 blood glucose was not manipulated in group ii n 10 blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40 glucose to <NUM> <NUM> mg dl in group ii n 10 blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to <NUM> <NUM> mg dl <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest cpr chest compressor ventilator thumper and epinephrine infusion was commenced and continued for <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> thereafter defibrillation was attempted and if successful the animals were observed for another <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> cerebral perfusion pressure cpp cbf cmro2 coronary perfusion pressure corpp and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control after <NUM> min of cpr and at 10 30 and <NUM> min post cpr <EOS>
<SOS> in group i 4 9 animals 44 could be successfully resuscitated in group ii 4 10 40 and in group ii 0 10 0 <EOS>
<SOS> prior to cardiac arrest mean arterial pressure cpp and corpp in group ii were significantly lower compared to groups i and ii <EOS>
<SOS> in group i cpp during cpr was <NUM> <NUM> mmhg cbf <NUM> <NUM> ml min 100 g cmro2 <NUM> <NUM> ml min 100 g corpp <NUM> <NUM> mmhg and left ventricular lv flow <NUM> <NUM> ml min 100 g in group ii cpp 21 5 cbf <NUM> 7 cmro2 <NUM> 0 8 corpp <NUM> 6 and lv flow <NUM> 9 and in group ii cpp <NUM> 3 cbf <NUM> 8 cmro2 <NUM> 1 1 corpp <NUM> 2 and lv flow <NUM> <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> during the 240 min post resuscitation period there were no differences in cbf cmro2 or lv flow between groups i and ii <EOS>
<SOS> hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia <EOS>
<SOS> in addition hyperglycaemia did not affect lv flow cbf or cmro2 <EOS>
<SOS> however it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia <EOS>
<SOS> abstract <NUM> we present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type i ga1 <EOS>
<SOS> normal urinary organic acids in patients with non specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely and no further investigations are required <EOS>
<SOS> in other patients the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical neuroradiological and biochemical findings <EOS>
<SOS> gcdh enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom ga1 is very likely <EOS>
<SOS> this article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time <EOS>
<SOS> malignant lymphomas originating from peripheral t or nk cells are rare tumours in europe and account for less than 10 of all malignant lymphomas <EOS>
<SOS> in this review the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from t or nk cells will be presented <EOS>
<SOS> nasal nk t cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often but not always display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis <EOS>
<SOS> the tumor cells consistently express cd56 cd2 and the eber molecules encoded by the epstein barr virus <EOS>
<SOS> clonal t cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating in the majority of cases a derivation of these tumors from nk cells <EOS>
<SOS> enteropathy type intestinal t cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> the tumour cells express t cell antigens cd103 and cytotoxic molecules but are negative for cd4 <EOS>
<SOS> approximately 20 of the cases display cd56 mostly in combination with cd8 <EOS>
<SOS> recently an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified <EOS>
<SOS> histologically these cases resemble celiac disease however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent cd8 and t cell receptor protein expression and they are clonal by molecular analysis <EOS>
<SOS> clinically the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour forming t cell lymphoma <EOS>
<SOS> angioimmunoblastic t cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm arborizing high endothelial venules and large fdc meshworks as well as clinical features systemic symptoms signs of a dysregulated immune response <EOS>
<SOS> peripheral t cell lymphomas that do not fit into a distinct entity are classified in the real and the new who classifications as peripheral t cell lymphomas unspecified <EOS>
<SOS> these display a broad morphological spectrum including the t cell lymphomas of different cell sizes lennert is lymphoma and t zone lymphoma of the kiel classification and in general are clinically aggressive <EOS>
<SOS> causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand <EOS>
<SOS> since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions <EOS>
<SOS> a central role is played by the active passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy <EOS>
<SOS> the difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions <EOS>
<SOS> at the same time knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system <EOS>
<SOS> isolated severe head trauma sht or sht in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents <EOS>
<SOS> the prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage <EOS>
<SOS> causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia as well as inflammatory processes <EOS>
<SOS> both isolated sht and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure mof <EOS>
<SOS> often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal <EOS>
<SOS> the hypermetabolism after sht is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the consequences of sht for the whole organism multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> moreover coagulation metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of sirs as well <EOS>
<SOS> our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited <EOS>
<SOS> in this context the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies <EOS>
<SOS> this article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic <EOS>
<SOS> background chronic cough and thoracic pain commonly caused by upper airway infections are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics <EOS>
<SOS> these benign symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders <EOS>
<SOS> methods in two patients male age 41 12 and 43 12 years chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm pleuropulmonary blastoma <EOS>
<SOS> results pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> an incomplete resection was performed in both cases <EOS>
<SOS> both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> one boy died the other one is alive and well more than <NUM> years after diagnosis without evidence of disease <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy can provide a long term remission <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study <EOS>
<SOS> in the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers mean sd <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> °c could be found after relaxation hypnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in the second step six patients study group gained experience with autogenic training <EOS>
<SOS> the other six patients served as control group <EOS>
<SOS> in the study group the skin temperature of the fingers short term effect was significantly higher than in the control group 1 9 <NUM> <NUM> °c <EOS>
<SOS> long term effects of the autogenic training mean acral rewarning time duration and course of the raynaud attacks acral lesions of the hands psychosomatic status of complaints type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease were not found within the relatively short follow up period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> two patients however reported that they could shorten the duration of raynaud attacks by autogenic training <EOS>
<SOS> in our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset <EOS>
<SOS> as far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned the patients could be assessed as almost adapted <EOS>
<SOS> hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis <EOS>
<SOS> abstract the term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea cough and count or purulence of sputum <EOS>
<SOS> the management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management hospital management or intensive care treatment <EOS>
<SOS> cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors <EOS>
<SOS> the first line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug treatment with 2 agonists and anticholinergics <EOS>
<SOS> systemic steroids as a short term course are advocated if hospital treatment is necessary <EOS>
<SOS> infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations <EOS>
<SOS> however a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state <EOS>
<SOS> antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present <EOS>
<SOS> the severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms <EOS>
<SOS> this should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas exchange and to reduce the work of breathing <EOS>
<SOS> as a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced <EOS>
<SOS> if invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered <EOS>
<SOS> background in <NUM> prof h olbing university of essen pediatrics department supported by prof g stickler mayo medical school minnesota introduced a 4 weeks clinical skills lab for all students annual class 250 based on self instruction by means of computer assisted interactive audiovisual learning materials models bedside teaching and seminars on special topics partially peer guided <EOS>
<SOS> each year <NUM> chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching <EOS>
<SOS> the peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills <EOS>
<SOS> each tutor is active during 4 5 skills lab periods and in each period he she coaches two groups of two students each <EOS>
<SOS> during the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients <EOS>
<SOS> spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons <EOS>
<SOS> up to <NUM> years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons <EOS>
<SOS> there are two typical lesions odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine <EOS>
<SOS> odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly <EOS>
<SOS> this is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine is stiffness in old age <EOS>
<SOS> instable fractures in extension type ii are most common <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x ray <EOS>
<SOS> conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type ii while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with halo fixateur e g we think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation <EOS>
<SOS> if this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion c1 c2 with transarticular screwing e g should be done <EOS>
<SOS> because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently <EOS>
<SOS> in many cases it is not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions <EOS>
<SOS> therefore there are just few compression fractures a type that have to be treated operatively <EOS>
<SOS> instable lesions type b and c must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young <EOS>
<SOS> because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments <EOS>
<SOS> an even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement <EOS>
<SOS> following curative minimal invasive laser resection of t1 t3 laryngeal carcinomas patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> therapy was effected twice a day for approximately <NUM> months utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy <EOS>
<SOS> before and after rehabilitation acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer supported measuring systems 1 the multidimensional voice program kay elementrics corp and 2 a novel software program developed in göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands <EOS>
<SOS> acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation <EOS>
<SOS> findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> the standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post therapeutic improvement <EOS>
<SOS> a further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to analogous parameters of other methods this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices <EOS>
<SOS> aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment <EOS>
<SOS> following conservative treatment incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal <EOS>
<SOS> after plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing <EOS>
<SOS> there are two broad types of pseudarthrosis vascular and nonvascular <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as x ray <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment of vascular nonunions is very common <EOS>
<SOS> mechanical stability is required therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable <EOS>
<SOS> osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications <EOS>
<SOS> much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance <EOS>
<SOS> these defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula to tibia operation <EOS>
<SOS> extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions <EOS>
<SOS> former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication <EOS>
<SOS> stability and immobilisation are necessary <EOS>
<SOS> treatment in the low frequency magnetic field shows no effect <EOS>
<SOS> correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis <EOS>
<SOS> aim of the study the goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in <NUM> year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of <MOB> g in addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied <EOS>
<SOS> background although the majority of surgeons regard hartmann is operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> advocates of one stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results high morbidity and mortality and long term outcome low rates of intestinal restoration <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after hartmann is operation justify this criticism <EOS>
<SOS> method from <NUM> to <NUM> hartmann is operations were performed in <NUM> patients for colonic perforations <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications <EOS>
<SOS> the average mannheimer peritonitis index mpi was <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> seventeen patients died postoperatively mortality <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients 80 intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of <NUM> days complication rate <NUM> no mortality <EOS>
<SOS> on follow up patients were asked to give information on their general state changes of housing abdominal complaints and quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> results data on <NUM> of patients could be obtained <EOS>
<SOS> the median follow up time was <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> eleven patients had died the remaining <NUM> were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> 86 described the quality of their lives as good or very good only <NUM> indicated severe loss of activity <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored <EOS>
<SOS> anastomotic strictures developed in <NUM> of cases always after stapled anastomosis <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions according to our results long term outcome after hartmann is operation is good <EOS>
<SOS> 80 of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity 6 and no mortality <EOS>
<SOS> a great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity <EOS>
<SOS> tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and hence are often overlooked <EOS>
<SOS> clinical examination and ct scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the gait laboratory <EOS>
<SOS> only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints <EOS>
<SOS> however patellofemoral instability osgood schlatter disease osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless mentally ill subjects in munich take advantage of available psychosocial services <EOS>
<SOS> to obtain a representative picture of the situation the first step was to ascertain how many people in munich are actually homeless <EOS>
<SOS> the next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> using the standardized diagnostic interview schedule dis <NUM> men and <NUM> women were interviewed <EOS>
<SOS> the results according to the dsm ii demonstrated high lifelong and 6 month prevalence of psychic disturbances <EOS>
<SOS> medical and social services were often enjoyed but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations <EOS>
<SOS> women were treated more often than men <EOS>
<SOS> elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients seeking help <EOS>
<SOS> despite a high prevalence of addictive disease alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted <EOS>
<SOS> the increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help <EOS>
<SOS> most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety <EOS>
<SOS> by means of logistic regression models predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great <EOS>
<SOS> continued treatment occurs only rarely <EOS>
<SOS> electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long qt syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> in borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long qt syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making <EOS>
<SOS> in recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long qt assessment <EOS>
<SOS> aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long qt disorder it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long qt syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long qt family members <EOS>
<SOS> performing linkage analysis coupling of autosomal dominant congenital long qt syndrome romano ward syndrome to chromosomes <NUM> lqt1 11p15 5 <NUM> lqt3 3p21 <NUM> lqt2 7q35 and <NUM> lqt4 4q25 27 was demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> more recently the disease genes in long qt syndrome 1 2 and <NUM> could be identified <EOS>
<SOS> analysis of the base pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity <EOS>
<SOS> aside from diagnostic aspects molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion channel disorder leading to qt prolongation and sudden death <EOS>
<SOS> during the past <NUM> years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry goldmann perkins generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry schioetz is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a 24 year old woman with a plunging ranula is reported <EOS>
<SOS> primarily the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck which had developed <NUM> months previously <EOS>
<SOS> the polycystic firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed <EOS>
<SOS> pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology pathogenesis clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described <EOS>
<SOS> various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value <EOS>
<SOS> we prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland therefore its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences <EOS>
<SOS> in extensive cases the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised <EOS>
<SOS> cranial dural fistulae are rare when they occur it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage <EOS>
<SOS> with a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery <EOS>
<SOS> the examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination <EOS>
<SOS> sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility <EOS>
<SOS> in all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected <EOS>
<SOS> in most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery in addition <EOS>
<SOS> a possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw doppler sonography but not for colour coded duplex sonography <EOS>
<SOS> therefore cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect doppler sonographic criteria using cw doppler and duplex sonography <EOS>
<SOS> direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed <EOS>
<SOS> background echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease <EOS>
<SOS> the good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects <EOS>
<SOS> dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies <EOS>
<SOS> in germany as in all industrial nations there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer related mortality <EOS>
<SOS> according to the german federal bureau of statistics in <NUM> nearly 213 00 persons died due to malignant cancer <EOS>
<SOS> cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all <EOS>
<SOS> pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family <EOS>
<SOS> although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians <EOS>
<SOS> this work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine <EOS>
<SOS> this retrospective study shows the results in <NUM> patients of revision surgery on their reruptured acl <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up time was <NUM> months on average range <NUM> <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up examination included subjective lysholm score tegner activity level rating score clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the kt 100 arthrometer <EOS>
<SOS> the overall evaluation was done according to the ikdc score <EOS>
<SOS> the follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on acl <EOS>
<SOS> the ikdc score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results which demonstrated that revision acl surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery <EOS>
<SOS> nevertheless we recommend reconstruction of a torn acl even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration <EOS>
<SOS> nowadays restorative proctocolectomy is considered the gold standard in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis <EOS>
<SOS> alternative procedures such as brooke ileostomy or kock pouch are limited to special indications <EOS>
<SOS> preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure <EOS>
<SOS> quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality of life questionnaires <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life depending on the intensity of their disease <EOS>
<SOS> proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> when evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity <EOS>
<SOS> the total quality of life index is not impoved <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures <EOS>
<SOS> decreased quality of life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time <EOS>
<SOS> in some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems <EOS>
<SOS> on the other hand patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively patients should be aware of this risk benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle <EOS>
<SOS> the joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by bergmann et al <EOS>
<SOS> 1993 were converted into a pelvic reference system based on kinematic gait analysis <EOS>
<SOS> in eight cadaveric hip joints age 18 75 yrs <EOS>
<SOS> the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle heel strike mid stance heel off toe off and the pressure distribution determined with fuji pressure sensitive film <EOS>
<SOS> we found maxima of <NUM> mpa during mid stance <EOS>
<SOS> the areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro superior aspect of the acetabulum anterior part of the acetabular roof and in the dorso inferior aspect of the lunate surface <EOS>
<SOS> the pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load <EOS>
<SOS> the normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum <EOS>
<SOS> during operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible <EOS>
<SOS> in spite of its serious sequelae volatile substance abuse vsa attracts very little public attention in germany <EOS>
<SOS> our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes <EOS>
<SOS> initially he achieved short lived euphoria and hallucinations <EOS>
<SOS> he compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage finally consuming <NUM> litres of fluid propane daily <EOS>
<SOS> getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane <EOS>
<SOS> since he abused the propane in an apartment house he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion <EOS>
<SOS> clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation restricted perceptivity and concentration reduced mnemonic performance and psychomotor agitation <EOS>

<SOS> the indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described <EOS>
<SOS> clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children <EOS>
<SOS> in specific well defined applications the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising <EOS>
<SOS> sonography provides important additional information to chest x ray and is even superior to ct under special circumstances <EOS>
<SOS> pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional x ray and more expensive cross sectional imaging <EOS>
<SOS> in the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used <EOS>
<SOS> traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs <EOS>
<SOS> the involvement of radiologists has been limited <EOS>
<SOS> in the past few years dedicated ct software programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws <EOS>
<SOS> the complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial panoramic and cross sectional images <EOS>
<SOS> with this anatomic description dental ct scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible <EOS>
<SOS> an overview of the technique of dental ct is provided furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained <EOS>
<SOS> suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given <EOS>
<SOS> the debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the german speaking media and in professional publications within recent years <EOS>
<SOS> this discussion however largely excluded mentally ill <NUM> patients <EOS>
<SOS> also euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from <NUM> euthanasia in psychiatric patients <EOS>
<SOS> we report here two cases from our hospital in which in patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass <EOS>
<SOS> we discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder <EOS>
<SOS> definition of the problem in germany the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other european countries <EOS>
<SOS> although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious scruples neither the christian church nor piety stand opposite to the practise of autopsies <EOS>
<SOS> currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography tee without loss of echocardiographic quality <EOS>
<SOS> methods in the present prospective study the nasally inserted miniaturized tee probe was tested in <NUM> ventilated patients and compared with a conventional tee probe <EOS>
<SOS> echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection 50 50 75 <MOB> in the left ventricular short and long axis views <EOS>
<SOS> results in <NUM> patients more than 50 of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes <EOS>
<SOS> although the nasal tee probe was inferior to conventional tee in detecting lateral endocardium automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods <EOS>
<SOS> inter and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross sectional area was below 5 on average and differed non significantly with regard to the method <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized tee probe and mucosa <EOS>
<SOS> conclusions in comparison with conventional tee the miniaturized tee probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring <EOS>
<SOS> by means of modern color coded duplex sonography ccds even very small vessels can be visualized <EOS>
<SOS> maximum resolution nowadays is about <NUM> mm diameter of the vessel <EOS>
<SOS> we compared the use of ccds and angiography in studying of acral perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> besides morphologic criteria hemodynamic criteria were recorded <EOS>
<SOS> arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border <EOS>
<SOS> the physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded <NUM> cm s <EOS>
<SOS> ccds revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans <EOS>
<SOS> segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than <NUM> cm s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis as proven by angiographic examinations <EOS>
<SOS> ccds is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary raynaud is syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation other possible applications of ccds are in in the surgical field for example replantations in hand or finger surgery <EOS>
<SOS> the discussion of the osheroff vs chestnut lodge court case in the american journal of psychiatry raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression <EOS>
<SOS> a summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the icd 10 research criteria study <EOS>
<SOS> in the case of one patient with dysthymia icd 10 rc f34 1 psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists <EOS>
<SOS> by contrast the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists <EOS>
<SOS> for certain patients an integrated therapy may be more effective <EOS>
<SOS> a 43 year old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery <EOS>
<SOS> using the cross over approach from the contralateral side it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed <EOS>
<SOS> in order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique <EOS>
<SOS> afterwards three stents were placed <EOS>
<SOS> subsequently the patient completely improved treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion using the kissing balloon technique laser assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments <EOS>
<SOS> a surgical procedure can thus be avoided <EOS>
<SOS> the typical mri features of the most common pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have been established <EOS>
<SOS> however even in these common pancreatic disorders mri correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons <EOS>
<SOS> we emphasize mr pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes including pancreatitis adenocarcinoma acinar cell carcinoma rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms and islet cell tumors <EOS>
<SOS> by highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with mr findings a better understanding of the mr appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided <EOS>
<SOS> in addition mri may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors <EOS>
<SOS> background the implantation of a femoro popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro popliteal region <EOS>
<SOS> application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel endovascular implantable bypass system <EOS>
<SOS> the device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> the present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans <EOS>
<SOS> methods the endopass consists of a thin wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of <NUM> cm <EOS>
<SOS> the distal end is connected with a self expanding stent prothesis <NUM> cm in length <EOS>
<SOS> endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision <EOS>
<SOS> following antegrade ringstripper tea the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire <EOS>
<SOS> the proximal anastomosis is performed surgically <EOS>
<SOS> results the technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on <NUM> cadaver extremities <EOS>
<SOS> implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery <EOS>
<SOS> the most important problems included the complete ringstripper tea the placement of the guide wire following the tea and the expansion of the endopass <EOS>
<SOS> following approval by the ethics commission the endopass was implanted in five patients between june <NUM> and march <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in three patients the endopass remained patent and has functioned well <EOS>
<SOS> one patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion while in the remaining case perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method <EOS>
<SOS> further development and methodological improvement however are necessary requiring additional larger studies on patients <EOS>
<SOS> introduction there is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells <EOS>
<SOS> therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> in order to evaluate patients exposure to radiation in computed tomography dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index ctdi multiple scan average dose msad and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used <EOS>
<SOS> the ctdi and the msad derivable from the ctdi are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors <EOS>
<SOS> the dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk <EOS>
<SOS> the declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side <EOS>
<SOS> as physical dose quantities the ctdi msad and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure <EOS>
<SOS> prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades <EOS>
<SOS> however stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge <EOS>
<SOS> due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in <NUM> consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability baroreflex sensitivity and more traditional markers such as non sustained ventricular tachycardia left ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular late potentials <EOS>
<SOS> patiens were followed for a mean of <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function both autonomic markers and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint i e all cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events <EOS>
<SOS> with respect to the secondary endpoint ventricular tachyarrhythmic events left ventricular function heart rate variability and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors <EOS>
<SOS> ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events <EOS>
<SOS> these findings from a large prospective long term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death <EOS>
<SOS> k channels and cardiotoxicity of drugs implications for drug toxicity assessment the time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the qt interval of the ecg and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier k current ik which consists of a rapid component ikr and a slow component iks <EOS>
<SOS> drugs that block cardiac ikr prolong the cardiac action potential ap <EOS>
<SOS> prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer qt interval on the ecg <EOS>
<SOS> during prolonged aps increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations which increase the risk of torsades de pointes tdp cardiac arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> tdp arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line <EOS>
<SOS> it has a rate of <NUM> to <NUM> beats min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal <EOS>
<SOS> the incidence of drug induced tdp arrhythmias is highest among class ia and class ii antiarrhythmic agents <EOS>
<SOS> however under certain clinical conditions also several non cardiovascular medicinal products induce qt interval prolongations in the ecg or tdp arrhythmias <EOS>
<SOS> since all drugs known to cause tdp block ikr an early evaluation of possible effects on aps of cardiac myocytes expressing ikr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended <EOS>
<SOS> if in vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce ap prolongation and or k channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations <NUM> either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to tdp arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies <EOS>
<SOS> carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated <EOS>
<SOS> to a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion <EOS>
<SOS> in turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival <EOS>
<SOS> in the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication <EOS>
<SOS> if delayed lymphadenectomy is performed the survival rate is reduced by approximately <NUM> as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy <EOS>
<SOS> the modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by catalona leads to less complications <EOS>
<SOS> if performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer <EOS>
<SOS> recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the <NUM> axes of the opd diagnosis a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented <EOS>
<SOS> the examination is structured in <NUM> phases the opening scene exploration of specific examples for relationships exploration of experience of self and others of therapy motivation and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight <EOS>
<SOS> the syndrome diagnosis according to icd <NUM> is completed in a final phase <EOS>
<SOS> this psychodynamic diagnostic assessment interview is recommended apart from the use for opd diagnosis for use a clinical instrument <EOS>
<SOS> cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in aids patients <EOS>
<SOS> before the introduction of triazol antibiotics like difluconazole the frequency of this meningitis among aids patients was 5 10 yet declined during the last years <EOS>
<SOS> clinically nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation predominate while focal neurological signs are rare <EOS>
<SOS> rapid institution of high dose antimycotic therapy is the keystone to improve prognosis and decrease mortality <EOS>
<SOS> antimycotics of choice are amphotericin b fluconazole and flucytosin <EOS>
<SOS> diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using india ink and cryptococcal cultures <EOS>
<SOS> recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies <EOS>
<SOS> during the last years life long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established <EOS>
<SOS> cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin b are a special challenge yet fortunately are rare <EOS>
<SOS> longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression <EOS>
<SOS> therefore combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern antiviral substances is important <EOS>
<SOS> clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence based medicine <EOS>
<SOS> the effect of aprotinin <MOB> iu as a bolus <MOB> ju h until the end of the operation on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation study group n 9 placebo group n 9 was investigated in a randomised double blind study <EOS>
<SOS> coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast to the published results no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> however aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase <EOS>
<SOS> the mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group <EOS>
<SOS> co existing inflammation and epidermal hyperproliferation characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different <URL> models highlight some points of the multicausal pathogenesis of psoriasis <EOS>
<SOS> based on observations made in the animal models a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis the elements of which can be tested in a recently established xenogeneic transplantation model <EOS>
<SOS> adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations <EOS>
<SOS> in some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated <EOS>
<SOS> in myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t 12 16 creates a fusion gene between the chop gene and the fus gene and in lipomas the hmgi c gene becomes rearranged by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region 12q<MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> based on examples of a lipoma a well differentiated liposarcoma a myxoid liposarcoma and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases <EOS>
<SOS> the primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means <EOS>
<SOS> therefore image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton the intrinsic structures and the surrounding soft tissue are presented synoptically <EOS>
<SOS> the pattern erg perg is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function <EOS>
<SOS> up to now reports on the reproducibility of the perg have been contradictory <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming iscev guidelines for the perg <EOS>
<SOS> we simultaneously recorded the perg and vep in <NUM> eyes of <NUM> subjects to phase reversing checkerboard stimuli with dtl electrodes <EOS>
<SOS> both transient 2 rps and steady state 16 rps stimulation was employed <EOS>
<SOS> the check sizes were <NUM> ° <NUM> ° and <NUM> ° the mean luminance <NUM> cd m2 the contrast 98 and the field size <NUM> °x27 ° <EOS>
<SOS> measurements were repeated at the same time of day after <NUM> week <EOS>
<SOS> in addition we compared two different electrode positions in <NUM> eyes 1 across the cornea along the lower lid and deep in the conjunctival sac <EOS>
<SOS> with position 1 the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20 than 2 <EOS>
<SOS> we calculated the coefficient of variation cv of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility <EOS>
<SOS> cv was <NUM> 1 for the steady state perg <NUM> 1 for the transient perg <NUM> 2 for the steady state vep and <NUM> 3 for the transient vep <EOS>
<SOS> for the latency of the perg the intersession cv was found to be 1 5 <EOS>
<SOS> amplitude reproducibility was somewhat higher under steady state as compared to transient stimulation we attribute this to the high noise rejection of the fourier analysis <EOS>
<SOS> altogether the amplitude reproducibility of the perg is somewhat higher than that of the vep <EOS>
<SOS> as a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin beating grabbing it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands <EOS>
<SOS> the majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum granulosum cells <EOS>
<SOS> punching onto foil covered sandbags resulted in a comparable transfer of cells <EOS>
<SOS> punches afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful `perpetrator victim assignment via dna typing <EOS>
<SOS> the dna did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves as positively confirmed by investigations of denucleated cell suspensions <EOS>
<SOS> the cell concentration achieved in model experiments however shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells <EOS>
<SOS> the results of this paper justify the requirement having weighed up the appropriate case specific modalities that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible <EOS>
<SOS> ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal to noise ratio <EOS>
<SOS> potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> contrast enhancement of continous wave doppler is indicated when the native recordings are noisy and no complete envelope of the doppler spectrum is obtained <EOS>
<SOS> in aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization <EOS>
<SOS> in mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation <EOS>
<SOS> however assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows <EOS>
<SOS> contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic confidence of the doppler investigation is further improved by the recording of the pulmonary venous flow which can be recorded in most of the patients following injection on contrast <EOS>
<SOS> therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic doppler is an alternative to transesophageal doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows <EOS>
<SOS> since <NUM> a report card system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the department of external quality assurance of the chamber of physicians of westphalia lippe <EOS>

<SOS> the most frequent and still increasing procedure was implantation of hemiprosthesis bipolar prosthesis from <NUM> in <NUM> to <NUM> in 1997 followed by total hip replacement decreasing from <NUM> in <NUM> to <NUM> in 1997 <EOS>
<SOS> operative treatment was performed in more than <NUM> of all fractures in all counties of westphalia lippe <EOS>
<SOS> however there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement the percentage of hip replacements differed between <NUM> and <NUM> among different counties <EOS>
<SOS> average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long 1 6 days in 1997 <EOS>
<SOS> the etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial <EOS>
<SOS> in most patients it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and or painful range of motion of the cervical spine <EOS>
<SOS> upon recognition of the os odontoideum it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial <EOS>
<SOS> this is in contrast to an unstable os odontoideum which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon <EOS>
<SOS> in this study we present the results of our treatment of four patients with an unstable os odontoideum <EOS>
<SOS> in all four cases a c1 2 fusion was performed 3 x magerl seemann <NUM> gallie brooks <EOS>
<SOS> postoperatively we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved <EOS>
<SOS> the range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> as a result we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life threatening neurological complications <EOS>
<SOS> several studies from anglo american countries indicate that in non psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well while in austria and germany until now no studies concerning this question exist <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we investigated the influence of psychiatric comorbidity on the length of stay in <NUM> patients of medical surgical and gynecological departments in vienna and tyrol <EOS>
<SOS> based on the clinical interview schedule 28 1 of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders <EOS>
<SOS> the presence of psychiatric disorders as well as type of hospital department medical department higher age more previous non psychiatric treatment periods and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid the influence of cofounding variables psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non cases <EOS>
<SOS> the mentally ill group was treated for a markedly longer period as inpatients than the mentally well <EOS>
<SOS> patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> the development of new cardiopulmonary bypass technologies special surgical instruments as well as intrathoracic video systems facilitates mitral surgery via a small right thoracotomy <EOS>
<SOS> functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor <EOS>
<SOS> when reposition and internal fixation fail the remaining alternatives are hemi arthroplasty and or arthrodesis <EOS>
<SOS> in a 50 year old patient we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis a neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side <EOS>
<SOS> using this strategy the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery which ist especially important for young and active patients <EOS>
<SOS> commonly used regiments for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis gastric lavage and activated charcoal <EOS>
<SOS> it was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically <EOS>
<SOS> the results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed <EOS>

<SOS> the methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery <EOS>
<SOS> retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire based outcome analyses <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long term results of the stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire <EOS>
<SOS> of <NUM> consecutive patients <NUM> 80 2 returned a questionnaire on long term continence complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result <EOS>
<SOS> with a mean follow up of <NUM> months <NUM> of <NUM> evaluable patients 50 0 remained completely continent while <NUM> 11 5 never became continent and <NUM> 38 5 had recurrent incontinence 6 90 months postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> almost two thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than <NUM> years after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate <EOS>
<SOS> our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future <EOS>
<SOS> social work for the elderly in a demographical ageing society is not justified per se but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age structure <EOS>
<SOS> in the field of practice this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to searching for profiles of performance with greater attraction <EOS>
<SOS> pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery ica can be caused by external injury or may be due to spontaneous dissection <EOS>
<SOS> pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio arterial embolism <EOS>
<SOS> treatment of pseudoaneurysms is influenced by the location and the type of injury associated injurys collaterals to the ipsilateral hemisphere neurological signs and symptoms growth of the lesion and patient age <EOS>
<SOS> potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy extra intracranial bypass resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ica <EOS>
<SOS> pseudoaneurysms of the ica adjacent to the scull base require a major surgical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> if there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives <EOS>

<SOS> a clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed <EOS>
<SOS> methods <NUM> survey mammograms in 1 5 or 1 7 fold magnification and <NUM> 4 fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor based digital system <EOS>
<SOS> an intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> results the diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences <EOS>
<SOS> spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of cases diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion the combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms <EOS>
<SOS> digital 4 fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications <EOS>

<SOS> in rheumatic diseases radiation synovectomy is a reliable method <EOS>
<SOS> meanwhile radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy <EOS>
<SOS> in addition combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and therefore a higher radiation exposure is possible <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> patients we found radionuclide emigration in <NUM> cases by whole body scintigraphy resulting in a 50 percentile with 68 27 confidence interval of <NUM> <MOB> of the injected yttrium 90 activity <EOS>
<SOS> comparison of <NUM> groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference p0 05 <EOS>
<SOS> because of the found radionuclide emigration a radiation dose of <NUM> <MOB> 18 msv in women and <NUM> <MOB> msv in men was calculated <EOS>
<SOS> for lymph nodes liver spleen and whole body radiation doses of <NUM> <MOB> msv <NUM> <MOB> msv <NUM> <MOB> msv and <NUM> 9 99 msv were calculated <EOS>
<SOS> gonadal radiation dose can be neglected and the morbidity rate for tumors bacause of the whole body radiation dose is low with a value of <NUM> per thousand <EOS>
<SOS> therefore radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality <EOS>
<SOS> the goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity <EOS>
<SOS> fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft <EOS>

<SOS> pneumatic external counterpulsation operates by applying ecg triggered diastolic pressure via cuffs to the vascular bed of the lower limbs <EOS>
<SOS> comparable with intra aortic balloon pumping pecp produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> american asian and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of pecp one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks <EOS>
<SOS> exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement <EOS>
<SOS> pecp is a virtually riskfree treatment option in patients suffering from angina despite medical and interventionell treatment <EOS>
<SOS> opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit <EOS>
<SOS> transrectal fine needle aspiration biopsy fnab of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non palpable nodules yielding high sensitivity ca <EOS>
<SOS> 95 and a low complication rate 1 <EOS>
<SOS> its specificity amounts to 97 <EOS>
<SOS> the scarcity of urologists trained in the fnab method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far <EOS>
<SOS> besides various forms of prostatitis five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated <EOS>
<SOS> while pin i cannot be cytologically identified pin ii ii lesions may lead to false positive diagnoses <EOS>
<SOS> cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic counterpart <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative radiologically controlled fnab of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca <EOS>
<SOS> 86 and specificity of 100 <EOS>
<SOS> it thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven <EOS>
<SOS> diagnostic dna cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability even without therapy constantly and representatively diploid and tetraploid patterns <EOS>

<SOS> all programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved <EOS>
<SOS> spontaneous breathing with biphasic positive airway pressure bipap or airway pressure release ventilation aprv caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> during spontaneous breathing with aprv bipap venous return cardiac output and oxygen delivery increased while oxygen consumption remained unchanged <EOS>
<SOS> in patients early spontaneous breathing with aprv bipap was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for <NUM> days and were then weaned with aprv bipap <EOS>
<SOS> length of mechanical ventilation intubation and icu stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with aprv bipap <EOS>

<SOS> various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty <EOS>
<SOS> since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years <EOS>
<SOS> vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages ii and ii according to ficat and ii ii and iv of the criteria of the arco system respectively which also bases on mri findings <EOS>
<SOS> we investigated the results of <NUM> patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft perfused by the a circumflexa ilium profunda between <NUM> and <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> mean follow up was 5 6 years <EOS>
<SOS> the evaluation was based on the harris hip score clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a vas visual analog scale <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86 1 <EOS>
<SOS> these results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7 9 points using the vas max <EOS>
<SOS> unchanged radiological appearance over the follow up period was observed in 47 5 using the arco criterias <EOS>
<SOS> reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts about <NUM> of the patients with a stage ii and ii according to ficat and ii ii and iv of the arco respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5 6 years after the procedure <EOS>

<SOS> therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma remains difficult <EOS>
<SOS> new therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated <EOS>
<SOS> the following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of <NUM> primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells <EOS>
<SOS> these data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine <EOS>
<SOS> all investigations were performed in regard to the p glycoprotein pgp expression of the cells which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance <EOS>
<SOS> four pgp positive and four pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses <EOS>
<SOS> toxicity was measured using the mtt toxicity assay as well as trypan blue exclusion <EOS>
<SOS> significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated <EOS>
<SOS> in addition the effects of treosulfan were not related to pgp expression <EOS>

<SOS> method we assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of cd44 standard and cd44 isoforms v4 v5 v6 v7 and v10 in <NUM> ductal pancreatic carcinomas by immunochemistry on paraffin embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection <EOS>
<SOS> at the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known <EOS>
<SOS> results there was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of cd44 splice variants <EOS>
<SOS> cd44 splice variants v4 v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue <EOS>
<SOS> in ductal pancreatic carcinoma patients with an overexpression of cd44 splice variants had a worse prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> however because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant <EOS>

<SOS> regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome tos congenital bone and or fibromuscular anomalies positional characteristics and trauma play a role <EOS>
<SOS> signs and symptoms are extremely variable depending on whether the compression of the plexus of the artery or of the vein is predominant <EOS>
<SOS> in the clinical examination the aest test is of utmost importance <EOS>
<SOS> the visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by das in different positions is mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> less than 5 of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm but 76 have obstructions of digital arteries <EOS>
<SOS> every patient must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times <EOS>
<SOS> anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle <EOS>

<SOS> regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed homogeneously within the organ <EOS>
<SOS> this phenomenon has been explained by the classical concept of west et al <EOS>
<SOS> based on the isolated canine lung <EOS>
<SOS> the concept stresses the importance of different gravitational forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion zone 1 waterfall like perfusion zone 2 and continuous blood flow zone 3 prevail <EOS>
<SOS> in this article we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the west model <EOS>
<SOS> a new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow heterogeneities <EOS>
<SOS> the pulmonary vasculature is composed of repetitions of one structural unit the vessel bifurcation <EOS>
<SOS> apart from its size each single bifurcation is similar to all others <EOS>
<SOS> the pulmonary vessel tree can therefore be considered to be self similar <EOS>
<SOS> self similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature <EOS>
<SOS> self similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self similar when viewed at different scales of magnification <EOS>
<SOS> for measurement of the structure of such objects and their function i e in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion fractal geometry is best suited <EOS>
<SOS> distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution <EOS>
<SOS> a major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements <EOS>
<SOS> thus fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species <EOS>
<SOS> fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes <EOS>

<SOS> in part i of the paper the biomechanical and technical background of the eptt using the mpt fixator and the indications for this procedure have been described <EOS>
<SOS> in part ii we report about the clinical application of the eptt in <NUM> patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism <EOS>
<SOS> 48 patients had fresh injuries <NUM> of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and <NUM> patients had neglected rsp <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> deep infections two of them related to the mpt fixator <EOS>
<SOS> in the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for <NUM> weeks in average <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical isokinetic and radiological results were reviewed in <NUM> patients with an average follow up time of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> there were <NUM> patients with partial patellectomy and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and <NUM> patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in midsubstance rupture <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical results according to the ikdc score were rated in <NUM> patients as normal in <NUM> patients as nearly normal and in <NUM> patients as abnormal <EOS>
<SOS> this rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees <EOS>
<SOS> from our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the eptt enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism disruptions with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period <EOS>
<SOS> the eptt allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches <EOS>
<SOS> thus the eptt represents an effective alternative to the patello tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments <EOS>
<SOS> ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv but it has not been proved to be superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy <EOS>

<SOS> twenty patients in the ondansetron group and <NUM> in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within <NUM> h the other patients up to <NUM> h after extubation <EOS>
<SOS> nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication <EOS>
<SOS> the reduction of these parameters after medication was similar <EOS>
<SOS> complete response over <NUM> h was 60 in the ondansetron and 68 in the droperidol group <EOS>
<SOS> in both groups the first medication failed in <NUM> cases during the initial <NUM> h twenty of the ondansetron and <NUM> of the droperidol patients needed a second dose among these <NUM> and 4 respectively a third ampoule <EOS>
<SOS> no rescue medication was necessary over <NUM> h and a mean of <NUM> ampoules was administered in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups <EOS>
<SOS> it was not possible to evaluate <NUM> interviews due to linguistic or amnestic problems <EOS>
<SOS> multiple side effects were noted frequently <EOS>
<SOS> injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol pruritus in the ondansetron group <EOS>
<SOS> ninety three percent of the ondansetron and 85 of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future ponv treatment <EOS>
<SOS> ondansetron 8 mg and droperidol 1 25 mg proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic <EOS>
<SOS> both drugs showed similar side effects <EOS>
<SOS> due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies <EOS>
<SOS> paradoxical embolism is well known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice <EOS>
<SOS> the typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis elevated right atrial pressure and a consecutive right to left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect <EOS>
<SOS> this review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion <EOS>
<SOS> internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus alternatively in the left pulmonary artery <EOS>
<SOS> in previous studies also a combined internal external cardioversion was used by locating a defibrillation electrode in the right atrium together with a cutaneous patch electrode <EOS>
<SOS> although in comparative studies the success rate of 91 93 with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67 79 with external cardioversion the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice <EOS>
<SOS> the success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from <NUM> to over 90 <EOS>
<SOS> possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants <EOS>

<SOS> vdd single lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing <EOS>
<SOS> to ensure an optimal atrial sensing function knowledge of the interactions between electrode design pacemaker amplifier and implantation technique is required <EOS>
<SOS> in this overview technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration surface area ring spacing full half ring design of the lead insulation material conductor coil configuration and amplifier design differential amplifier sensing impedance bandpass filter shall be explained and related to determinants at implant av distance site of implantation atrial position intraoperative measurement technique <EOS>
<SOS> 1 ring configuration bipolar atrial full ring systems have proved to be efficient with narrow 5 10mm or wide <MOB>mm ring spacing as well as bipolar half ring systems with dab configuration and narrow ring spacing <EOS>
<SOS> especially in a position close to the atrial wall a wide ring spacing detects a less clear cut signal than a short ring spacing on the other hand with a wide ring spacing sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall <EOS>
<SOS> a narrow ring spacing detects a sharper signal if positioned close to the atrial wall but a considerable reduction of sensed p wave amplitude may result if it moves away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front <EOS>
<SOS> 2 design of the lead polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation <EOS>
<SOS> a coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to manipulate the atrial part of the lead <EOS>
<SOS> thus if a position close to the atrial wall is desired the combination of a coaxial conductor coil polyurethane insulation and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising <EOS>
<SOS> 3 amplifier design for atrial sensing in vdd systems bipolar sensing differential amplifier high sensing impedance 2k and a wide bandpass filter e g <MOB>hz should be realized <EOS>
<SOS> especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range <MOB>hz is important because compared to a fixed atrial electrode a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low frequency range <EOS>
<SOS> 4 implantation to choose the best fitting electrode a preoperative assessment of the size of the right cardiac cavities should be performed <EOS>
<SOS> a position of the ring electrodes in the mid to high right atrium parallel to the lateral wall should be the goal <EOS>
<SOS> correct interpretation of the sensed p wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device bandpass filter signal peak to baseline or peak to peak <EOS>
<SOS> attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes <EOS>
<SOS> knowledge of different electrode pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of vdd single lead systems <EOS>
<SOS> preoperatively considerations should concern the choice of the electrode av distance ring spacing and implantation strategy position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall <EOS>
<SOS> an atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker <EOS>

<SOS> epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age <EOS>
<SOS> in light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy recurrent urinary tract infections irritable bladder and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician <EOS>
<SOS> to this day urinary incontinence in later life is considered normal and caused by old age <EOS>
<SOS> however among other age related reasons the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency <EOS>
<SOS> thus following thorough diagnostics pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration which rapidly enhance patients quality of life <EOS>

<SOS> two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance <EOS>
<SOS> objective to examine mortality mobility pain institutionalization rates six month after hip fractures <EOS>
<SOS> lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure <EOS>
<SOS> contraindications are an age over <NUM> years and an irreducible femoral head <EOS>
<SOS> for a long time we have used xenogenic deproteinized bone wedges from animals <EOS>
<SOS> we now use autoclaved and deep frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads <EOS>
<SOS> the wedges are sterilized at <NUM> <NUM> °c for <NUM> min and then kept deep frozen in the bone bank <EOS>
<SOS> our results in <NUM> patients show that this method is very successful even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique <EOS>
<SOS> it is unfortunate that the lateral acetabuloplasty with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals <EOS>
<SOS> there are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief <EOS>
<SOS> the intention of this prospective study is to demonstrate the influence of the nordoff robbins method of active music therapy in a group of <NUM> patients with fibromyalgia myofascial pain syndromes and polyarthritis on pain reduction life quality and coping <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio and video documented music therapy settings and to the self reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour <EOS>
<SOS> there was a significant reduction of pain intensity and pain related disability in the music group compared to a control group but no change in the depression and anxiety score <EOS>
<SOS> the influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles <EOS>
<SOS> active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain <EOS>
<SOS> psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction <EOS>
<SOS> clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other art therapies should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive phenomenological documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case <EOS>

<SOS> auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> however is there a clinical relevance <EOS>
<SOS> thus the present study was designed to identify parameters of vocal performance and acoustic features which are significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than in non related persons <EOS>
<SOS> in our hypothesis comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an artistic education of the voice could be due to these similarities <EOS>
<SOS> we compared intra pair differences with data from a control group <EOS>
<SOS> moreover we examined the correlation of intra pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins <EOS>
<SOS> a greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an exogene influence <EOS>
<SOS> in addition to the few phoniatric studies in twins in the literature we used current methods for acoustic analysis <EOS>
<SOS> we examined seven parameters of vocal performance and three acoustic features in <NUM> monozygotic twin pairs median age <NUM> years range 18 75 years and compared them with <NUM> control group pairs which consisted of non related persons of the same age and sex newly combined from the group of monozygotic twins statistical twins <EOS>
<SOS> we found significant differences in seven of ten parameters vocal range highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency fundamental speaking frequency maximum voice intensity number of partials vibrato of intensity u test by mann whitney <EOS>
<SOS> no correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters <EOS>
<SOS> the voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non related persons regarding the above mentioned features <EOS>
<SOS> thus the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable <EOS>
<SOS> results of the group comparison correlate largely with the literature <EOS>
<SOS> the missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable and or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects <EOS>
<SOS> after <NUM> <NUM> treatments our hm3 4 and mpl <NUM> have been replaced by the siemens lithostar multiline <EOS>
<SOS> as a eswl center with eswl as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new multifunctional lithotripter <EOS>
<SOS> the system consists of an electromagnetic shock wave emitter focus <NUM> x <NUM> mm and a digital fluoroscopy unit <EOS>
<SOS> stone localization is achieved in a <NUM> ° and <NUM> <NUM> ° position without movement of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment table itself allows most endourologic and percutaneous auxiliary procedures <EOS>
<SOS> additionally an intergrated inline ultrasound is available <EOS>
<SOS> from 10 94 to 08 95 <NUM> male and <NUM> female patients with a mean age of <NUM> 4 92 years underwent eswl with the lithostar multiline <EOS>
<SOS> the mean stone diameter was <NUM> 2 20 mm with <NUM> ureteral and <NUM> renal stones <EOS>

<SOS> stone localization was achieved after <NUM> 1 39 min mean fluoroscopy time <NUM> <MOB> min <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> no analgesic premedication was done <EOS>
<SOS> 56 of the patients needed no analgesics at all during eswl <EOS>
<SOS> 44 received <NUM> 2 15 mg piritramid intravenously <EOS>
<SOS> epidural anesthesia was performed in only <NUM> for a second treatment <EOS>
<SOS> 95 of the patients had complete stone disintegration <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> disintegration was achieved in one session <EOS>
<SOS> eswl was repeated for further disintegration in <NUM> because of an unsuccessful treatment in <NUM> and because of technical interruption of the previous session in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> we saw subkapsular haematomas in <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> auxiliary procedures following eswl were necessary in only <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> in situ eswl with the new lithostar multiline seems to be as effective as the dornier hm3 4 <EOS>
<SOS> analgesia free treatment was performed in more than <NUM> of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ eswl <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a strikingly frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection and subsequent ards in our hospital during the winter 1994 95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities <EOS>
<SOS> treatment modalities like inhalational ribavirin use of bronchodilators and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success <EOS>

<SOS> even in very severe cases of rsv infection treatment modalities like no hfov and ecmo can be used successfully <EOS>
<SOS> the use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible in those cases a pre existing bpd is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support <EOS>
<SOS> the vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus after orchiectomy <EOS>
<SOS> after leaving the human testis the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus <EOS>
<SOS> one of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery <EOS>
<SOS> computer aided 3 d reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord <EOS>
<SOS> the results obtained allowed us to subdivide the human spermatic cord into three compartments <EOS>
<SOS> the dorsomedial compartment contains the vas deferens and its blood vessels <EOS>
<SOS> the middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery <EOS>
<SOS> the ventrolateral compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery <EOS>
<SOS> this vein group is embedded in a large macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue <EOS>
<SOS> to be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared <EOS>
<SOS> it has known for a long time that sydenham is chorea and tics as seen in gilles de la tourette is syndrome gts are phenomenologically very similar <EOS>
<SOS> tics may occur as symptoms of acute sydenham is chorea or persist over years as residual symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> investigations of children suffering from gts including obsessive compusilve symptoms have provided signs of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective <EOS>
<SOS> we treated a 14 year old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of gts familial susceptibility and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with 7s immunoglobulins i v <EOS>
<SOS> response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics vocal tics and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> these findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system at least in a subgroup of gts <EOS>
<SOS> we report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus iddm or prediabetes <EOS>
<SOS> all three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii <EOS>
<SOS> among our patients with isolated iddm about <NUM> patients no case of itp was seen <EOS>
<SOS> therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii <EOS>
<SOS> the high rate of coronary artery disease cad mortality needs preventive intervention <EOS>
<SOS> several studies have documented the effectiveness of ldl cholesterol lowering in cad primary prevention <EOS>
<SOS> the west of scotland prevention study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through ldl cholesterol lowering <EOS>
<SOS> the data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction <EOS>
<SOS> high risk patients have besides high ldl cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease hypertension smoking low hdl cholesterol or diabetes <EOS>
<SOS> therapy primarily aims at life style changes secession of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve ldl cholesterol levels of <MOB> mg dl <MOB> mmol l depending on the individual risk constellation <EOS>
<SOS> this strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one cad event 56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia to 14 24 in high risk persons approaching the number n 13 known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease <EOS>
<SOS> one hundred and three cases of spitz nevi were reviewed <EOS>
<SOS> 36 of these patients were adults <EOS>
<SOS> the lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities <EOS>
<SOS> in adults they affect the legs in women and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults <EOS>
<SOS> spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for common melanocytic nevus hemangioma verruca fibrous histiocytoma molluscum contagiosum granuloma pyogenicum keloid and melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> histologically there are various expressions of spitz nevi but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle and or epithelioid melanocytes <EOS>
<SOS> there are only small histopathological differences between spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood one important feature rarely seen in spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the dermo epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus <EOS>
<SOS> nevus reed is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of spitz nevus <EOS>
<SOS> a few months ago an endovascular implantable ptfe stent graft became commercially available <EOS>
<SOS> since may <NUM> we have treated <NUM> patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level <EOS>
<SOS> the implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like orthograde ringstripping of the superficial femoral artery local tea and patch grafting of the femoral bifurcation angioplasty local lysis etc <EOS>
<SOS> the self expanding thin walled ptfe stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal p1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision <EOS>
<SOS> the implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma <EOS>
<SOS> radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia a and b patients undergoing long term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment <EOS>
<SOS> we report on <NUM> patients with severe and moderate haemophilia a and b receiving prophylactic treatment of between <NUM> and <NUM> years duration <EOS>
<SOS> three patient groups were evaluated according to the age at onset of prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> in group i n 8 prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first <NUM> years of life <EOS>
<SOS> patients of group ii n 6 received prophylaxis at the age of 3 6 years <EOS>
<SOS> late onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of <NUM> years and above in <NUM> patients group ii <EOS>
<SOS> all patients received virus inactivated f vii or f ix concentrates at dosages of 30 40 iu in some cases up to <NUM> iu kg body weight i v three times per week for those with haemophilia a and twice per week for those with haemophilia b elbow knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3 4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the world federation of haemophilia wfh <EOS>
<SOS> the total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients <EOS>
<SOS> in group i <NUM> out of <NUM> patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1 after a median of <NUM> years of prophylactic treatment <EOS>
<SOS> one patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations score 4 <EOS>
<SOS> patients of group ii showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry <EOS>
<SOS> worsening joint scores could be detected despite ongoing prophylaxis after the 3 year interval median orthopaedic score 4 median radiological score 8 <EOS>
<SOS> treatment group ii already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of <NUM> 0 33 and a median orthopaedic score of <NUM> 0 11 <EOS>
<SOS> despite prophylactic treatment both orthopaedic median 8 range 2 12 and radiological scores median 19 5 range 2 47 deteriorated after <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group i <EOS>
<SOS> in group ii a median of <NUM> joint bleeds range 1 8 were reported before prophylaxis was started <EOS>
<SOS> patients of group ii usually experienced a median of more than <NUM> joint haemorrhages range 6 10 or more <EOS>
<SOS> under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups ii and ii <EOS>
<SOS> however radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than <NUM> joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis <EOS>
<SOS> even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy <EOS>
<SOS> once apparent further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment group ii and ii <EOS>
<SOS> in order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia a and b <EOS>
<SOS> the hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion maintenance of an adequate cardiac output and restoration of mean arterial pressure <EOS>
<SOS> norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated when cardiac output is greater than <NUM> l min m2 or sv o2 65 and when blood pressure remains low <EOS>
<SOS> the objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 70 mmhg or more in some patients older or hypertensive patients <EOS>
<SOS> renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies urine output creatinine clearance and osmolar clearance are significantly increased <EOS>
<SOS> norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance as is the case in septic shock patients <EOS>
<SOS> the effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable <EOS>
<SOS> the effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients <EOS>
<SOS> provided that cardiac output is maintained treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation <EOS>
<SOS> in conclusion the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function <EOS>
<SOS> whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study <EOS>
<SOS> is it possible to find a correlation between the localisation of neovascularisations and the localisation and extension of the retinal ischemia <EOS>
<SOS> ischemia was recognized not as capillary non perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion <EOS>
<SOS> elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single chamber or dual chamber pacemaker <EOS>
<SOS> the frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion <EOS>
<SOS> the differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated <EOS>
<SOS> frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied <EOS>
<SOS> the long term history of <NUM> patients with known intermittent or durably successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation flutter was compared with <NUM> patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation <EOS>
<SOS> there was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups <EOS>
<SOS> the results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia <EOS>
<SOS> it therefore should be postulated for therapy of those patients <EOS>
<SOS> although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed <EOS>
<SOS> however the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients <EOS>
<SOS> this article focuses on the specific problems of handling preparation and practical performance of transfusions <EOS>
<SOS> some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients such as immunosuppressed transplanted or polytraumatic patients and critical care premature neonates <EOS>
<SOS> vincent is angina plaut vincent is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from fusibacteria and spirochaeta both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias <EOS>
<SOS> a possible symbiotic infection of both anaerobics may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the tonsillas <EOS>
<SOS> the clinical outcome may be different and pose difficulties in the differential diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> we report the case of a <NUM> year old female patient with necrotizing ulcera of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea <EOS>
<SOS> in case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections <EOS>
<SOS> the correct identification by cultivation turnes out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens <EOS>
<SOS> in case of fusospirochaetosis fusotreponematose a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture <EOS>
<SOS> this is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for bacteril identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea <EOS>
<SOS> quantitative tissue doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software tdi labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue doppler images <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in <NUM> volunteers the mean velocity of a <NUM> mm thick subendocardial slice during the systolic ejection period was determined from frozen doppler m mode images of the left ventricular posterior wall obtained using the left parasternal window <EOS>
<SOS> the same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional m mode slope approach <EOS>
<SOS> tissue doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity y 0 97x 0 17 r 0 77 p <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> the average wall motion gradient of the population was <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent <EOS>
<SOS> historically the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region <EOS>
<SOS> a question as to the status of development of the profession of geriatric nurse cannot be answered by reference to the current status of legislation on professional law matters <EOS>
<SOS> if experts in that field focus too long on such matters there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision <EOS>
<SOS> it is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the third reich <EOS>

<SOS> from a global viewpoint tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time <EOS>
<SOS> the situation in germany as in most comparable industrialized nations is stable <EOS>
<SOS> the declining trend of previous years continued in 1997 when 11 163 people developed active tuberculosis an incidence of 13 6 100 00 <EOS>
<SOS> however the tuberculosis <NUM> problem cannot be restricted to one country and germany is particularly affected by trends in eastern europe and in the former soviet countries <EOS>
<SOS> these countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis <NUM> cases and resistant strains during recent <NUM> years a tendency which can only be countered by fast well aimed and efficient action in the affected areas <EOS>
<SOS> the industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty <EOS>
<SOS> crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation <NUM> within each country are registration and <NUM> close observation of epidemiological trends identification of high risk groups and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures <EOS>
<SOS> we report about a <NUM> years old patient who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the ellbow after being arrested by the police <EOS>
<SOS> we report on the eighth known case of a mature metastasis of a mature teratoma of the testis <EOS>
<SOS> in a 19 year old patient who had undergone a pyeloplasty of the left renal pelvis <NUM> years before a mature metastasis of an occult mature teratoma of the testis was found at the former operation site <EOS>
<SOS> this case in addition to those published previously emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults <EOS>
<SOS> it is supposed that the mature teratoma originates as other testicular tumors from carcinoma in situ cells which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis <EOS>
<SOS> angiofibromas are usually characterized by their occurences in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx <EOS>
<SOS> even the suspicion of an extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with skepticism although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature <EOS>
<SOS> three cases of this fibro vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented 1 an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15 month old boy 2 a right paranasal localization in a 9 year old boy and 3 an angiofibroma limited to the right sphenoid sinus in a 6 year old boy <EOS>
<SOS> in all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal micro endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision <EOS>
<SOS> according to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre adolescent children with atypical localizations <EOS>
<SOS> the endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects <EOS>
<SOS> objective chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a helicobacter pylori associated gastritis <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children <EOS>
<SOS> the gastroscopy necessary for this often requires general anesthesia <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the present study was to etablish whether an elisa for helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated anesthesias <EOS>
<SOS> complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column <EOS>
<SOS> in this case there is no injury to the spinal cord because the saving fracture of the vertebral arc prevents it <EOS>
<SOS> one case of a severe dislocated fracture at t11 12 is reported <EOS>
<SOS> in practice a complete set of x rays should be done after high speed trauma even if no neurological deficit is present <EOS>
<SOS> the treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column <EOS>
<SOS> gamma hydroxybutyric acid ghb is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals <EOS>
<SOS> it has been used for almost <NUM> years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long term sedation <EOS>
<SOS> its convincing pharmacological properties without serious adresse effects on circulation or respiration are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action <EOS>
<SOS> this is not a major problem with long term sedation during icu treatment <EOS>
<SOS> ghb has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury where it compares favourably with barbiturates <EOS>
<SOS> in animal studies it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level <EOS>
<SOS> however in some experimental animals ghb has been shown to produce seizure like activities and the compound is being used to produce absence like seizures <EOS>
<SOS> ghb has been used in our icu for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients figthing the respirator during spontaneous respiration <EOS>
<SOS> no serious side effects were observed in these patients while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed both were reversible after discontinuation of ghb and restriction of additional sodium input somsanit the commercially available ghb preparation in germany contains <NUM> mmol sodium g the daily dose averages 20 40 g ghb i e <EOS>
<SOS> in europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage dpl in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma <EOS>
<SOS> hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum <EOS>
<SOS> in hemodynamically stable patients in addition to ultrasonography computed tomography can be done <EOS>
<SOS> this is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology e g <EOS>
<SOS> small amounts of hemoperitoneum <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk something which is rather rare <EOS>
<SOS> the injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident <EOS>
<SOS> computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion <EOS>
<SOS> in patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels <EOS>
<SOS> even after the strengthening by the law of 1997 the german criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry <EOS>
<SOS> the injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one is duty and benefits <EOS>
<SOS> according to this an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this <EOS>
<SOS> however it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise <EOS>
<SOS> in case of such an injustice it is under the new law no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization <EOS>
<SOS> thus it is in the interest of both research and industry to avoid the suspicion of corruption in the first place <EOS>
<SOS> a prerequisite for this is the strict observance of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects financed by third party funds <EOS>
<SOS> since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours current tumour therapy includes immunostimulation <EOS>
<SOS> this can be done by interleukin <NUM> il 2 which activates t and killer cells and induces lysis of the tumour <EOS>
<SOS> because the intravenous application of il 2 may have serious side effects we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study <EOS>
<SOS> both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> a total of <NUM> and 39x106 iu recombinant il 2 proleukin respectively was injected in increasing concentrations in one metastasis of each patient <EOS>
<SOS> histologically almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced <EOS>
<SOS> in comparison with the control specimen the t cell rich infiltrate increased intra and in particular peritumorally <EOS>
<SOS> while the ratio of helper to suppressor t cells remained unchanged the proportions of nk cells monocytes macrophages and il 2 receptor bearing cells increased <EOS>
<SOS> this reaction was restricted to treated metastases <EOS>
<SOS> no clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling <EOS>
<SOS> wear of the articulating components especially pe uhmw of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime <EOS>
<SOS> to minimize wear debris ceramic heads according to iso <NUM> al2o3 have been used from <NUM> paired with al2o3 and since <NUM> paired with pe uhmw <EOS>
<SOS> al2o3 balls articulating with cups made from cfrp have been in clinical use since <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> laboratory experiments and in vivo testing showed minimized wear debris and mild biological response to wear products using cfrp carbon fiber reinforced plastic instead of pe uhmw as the cup material <EOS>
<SOS> the articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads al2o3 biolox and cementless cfrp cups carbon fiber reinforced plastic caproman were compared using sphericity measurement techniques scanning electron microscopy sem and roughness measurements including advanced roughness parameters rvk or rpk according to iso 4287 <EOS>
<SOS> altogether the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination al2o3 ball cfrp cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations <EOS>
<SOS> the wear rates are comparable with the combination al2o3 al2o3 without the material related problems of ceramic components in all ceramic combinations <EOS>
<SOS> two cases where dna typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described <EOS>
<SOS> in both cases y chromosomal str systems have been used in combination with autosomal str systems <EOS>
<SOS> in the first case the dna from the fingernails of a female victim with skin particles of the male murderer was typed <EOS>
<SOS> the male dna in this mixture of male and female dna could be typed <EOS>
<SOS> the excess of female dna in the samples did not distrub the pcr reaction of y chromosomal systems <EOS>
<SOS> in the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person <EOS>
<SOS> the typing of the suspect is dna did not give any information because of a family relationship <EOS>
<SOS> different kinds of stains have been analysed with dys <NUM> i ii dys 390 dys 391 dys <NUM> dys <NUM> and dys19 <EOS>
<SOS> two multiplex pcr reactions were carried out to save time and stain material <EOS>
<SOS> although the y chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal str systems the analysis of combined haplotypes can give additional information in forensic casework <EOS>
<SOS> in a prospectively designed randomized study we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out of hospital treatment of <NUM> hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema defined as rales over both lungs and systolic blood pressure 200 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure 100 mg <EOS>
<SOS> the out of hospital treatment consists of oxygen 6 ll min via a face mask furosemide <NUM> mg i v opioids <NUM> mg s c and either sublingual nitroglycerine n 23 initial dose <NUM> mg repetitive application of <NUM> mg every <NUM> min until a cumulative dose of <NUM> mg or intravenous enalaprilat initial dose <NUM> mg repetitive application of <NUM> mg every <NUM> min until a cumulative dose of <NUM> mg <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below <NUM> mm hg and diastolic blood pressure below <NUM> mm hg until admission to the emergency department <EOS>
<SOS> in the emergency room an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory po2 pco2 and metabolic status ph value base excess serum lactate of the patient <EOS>
<SOS> successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13 23 57 patients of the enalaprilat group and 15 23 65 patients of the nitroglycerine group p 0 54 <EOS>
<SOS> systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups systolic rr enalaprilat <NUM> 31 mm hg nitroglycerine <NUM> 38 mm hg p 0 59 diastolic rr enalaprilat <NUM> 14 mm hg nitroglycerine <NUM> 14 mm hg p 0 12 <EOS>
<SOS> no significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission po2 <NUM> 15 vs <NUM> 17 mm hg p 0 50 pco2 <NUM> 9 vs <NUM> 13 p 0 75 ph value <NUM> 0 12 vs <NUM> 0 09 p 0 98 be 4 2 3 7 vs 5 7 4 1 p 0 23 lactate <NUM> 3 3 vs <NUM> 2 7 p 0 98 <EOS>
<SOS> intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out of hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema <EOS>
<SOS> paragangliomas of the glomus caroticum are relatively rare but highly vascularized neoplasmas which develop from chemoreceptors <EOS>
<SOS> they can be develop at anyage but most often in the third or fourth decade of life <EOS>
<SOS> paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin <EOS>
<SOS> there is a familial predisposition and an autosomal dominant transmission is presumed <EOS>
<SOS> they are commonly located in the jugular region in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found <EOS>
<SOS> we describe the case of a 47 year old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides <EOS>
<SOS> contrast enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions <EOS>
<SOS> we performed an operative exploration which showed a highly vascularized tumor <EOS>
<SOS> histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma <EOS>
<SOS> an angiography of the neck and thoracic region furthermore revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum <EOS>
<SOS> using a surgical approach via lateral cervicotomies and thoracotomy the paragangliomas were extirpated <EOS>
<SOS> our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas <EOS>
<SOS> this perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop <EOS>
<SOS> the extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography <EOS>
<SOS> because of the familial predisposition clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> in more than <NUM> years of development of intensive care medicine icm our speciality has acquired moral and ethical standpoints although not without public pressure and discussions <EOS>
<SOS> special commissions dealing e g with brain death terminal care ethics of foregoing life sustaining treatment in the critically ill withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation and other issues have meen formed in a number of medical societies <EOS>
<SOS> international consensus conferences have helped to clarify some of the issues <EOS>
<SOS> with increasing experience a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in icm that have to be dealt with such as the issue of quality of life <EOS>
<SOS> what is an unworthy life <EOS>
<SOS> are we allowed to make judgments for our patients <EOS>
<SOS> what is cost effectiveness in icm <EOS>
<SOS> other restrictions include bed and equipment shortages in the intensive care unit icu the necessity for triage undisputed in catastrophe medicine and how one should proceed in managing elective patients <EOS>
<SOS> in situations of limited icu bed availability sicker patients will be admitted sparing out patients who are less ill for observation and those with poor quality of life and poor prognosis <EOS>
<SOS> for the future it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an icu more than those who should not be admitted <EOS>
<SOS> an icu treatment entitlement index would be directly proportional to the probability of successful outcome and the quality of the remaining life and would be inversely related to costs for achieving success <EOS>
<SOS> the icu outcome with survival hospital mortality and follow up of icu patients is considered <EOS>
<SOS> dnr do not resuscitate the dying patient terminal care terminal weaning dnt do not treat active and passive euthanasia living wills quality of life and cost effectiveness for icu patients are defined <EOS>
<SOS> their application in the icu will be discussed and problems pointed out <EOS>
<SOS> outcome predictions using scores apache ii saps ii mpm have been developed based on previous experience but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in icus <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequent and difficult problem in the icu is the vegetative state which requires an exact diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> the differential diagnosis from other comatose states such as coma brain death and locked in syndrome is depicted <EOS>
<SOS> the ethics of interrupting life sustaining treatment in critically ill patients have been worked out by a task force on ethics of the society of critical care medicine 1990 <EOS>
<SOS> a consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or withdraw therapy <EOS>
<SOS> according to the consensus withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment <EOS>
<SOS> in my mind however there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding e g ventilation <EOS>
<SOS> a dissentive opinion by some members of the task force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care and should not be equated with medical intervention <EOS>
<SOS> the ethical problems associated with active euthanasia physician assisted suicide or death as practised in the netherlands are also discussed <EOS>
<SOS> in most countries this practice seems unacceptable <EOS>
<SOS> from <NUM> years experience in icm there are many more ethical questions and case reports without clear solutions <EOS>
<SOS> care decisions for single patients in unacceptable situations should be made after medical evaluation by the intensivist with the medical team and if possible by the patient and or his or her surrogate <EOS>
<SOS> legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients but ethics committees could be helpful in decision making <EOS>
<SOS> pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital acquired non traumatic posttraumatic and postoperative iatrogenic pseudarthroses <EOS>
<SOS> the various types of non unions of the spine are described according to their clinical and radiological appearance <EOS>
<SOS> in line with their clinical importance special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non union of the axis of c2 and to spondylolysis <EOS>
<SOS> for the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to gallie brooks is recommended in spondylolyses without marked slipping a direct repair should be considered in young patients <EOS>
<SOS> 207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the coss 86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane <EOS>
<SOS> the rate of responders <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> in relapse free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow up period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in chondroblastic osteosarcomas <EOS>
<SOS> therefore in addition to degree of regression histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas <EOS>
<SOS> the possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited <EOS>
<SOS> therefore cobalt chromium molybdenum alloys are currently being used for femoral components and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene for tribologically stressed tibial components <EOS>
<SOS> titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only <EOS>
<SOS> the fixation of hamstring grafts in acl reconstruction requires a connector device <EOS>
<SOS> during the process of ingrowing the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation <EOS>
<SOS> the following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no <NUM> ethibond <NUM> mm mersilene tape and <NUM> mm polylene tape <EOS>
<SOS> the material were tested as loops with a length of <NUM> mm including the knot similar to intraoperative conditions <EOS>
<SOS> the ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of <NUM> n and <NUM> n using a tension load machine <EOS>
<SOS> the ultimate tension load increased significantly only for mersilene from <NUM> n to <NUM> n however the highest ultimate tension load showed polylene with <NUM> n the oscillating load up to <NUM> n revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of <NUM> mm for ethibond <NUM> mm for polylene and <NUM> mm for mersilene <EOS>
<SOS> the elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of <NUM> mm <EOS>
<SOS> concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well <EOS>
<SOS> based on our results polylene showed the best mechanical properties <EOS>
<SOS> regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in acl reconstruction <EOS>
<SOS> on the basis of the results of <NUM> knee arthroscopies in children aged between <NUM> and <NUM> years in the period from <NUM> to <NUM> we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with haemarthrosis or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or mri <EOS>
<SOS> this trend shows a predominant therapeutic use of knee arthroscopy <EOS>
<SOS> taking our own incorrect clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children <EOS>
<SOS> rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum <EOS>
<SOS> the pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear <EOS>
<SOS> the case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which ct and mri initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto occipital lobes <EOS>
<SOS> at this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color coded sonography tccs revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm <EOS>
<SOS> mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid syphon initially reached <NUM> cm s and normalized within <NUM> weeks <EOS>
<SOS> while the patient is vision improved rapidly follow up mri disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex <EOS>
<SOS> this case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm <EOS>
<SOS> in such patients tccs may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia eclampsia <EOS>
<SOS> the principle of photodynamic therapy pdt for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically concentrating a drug photosensitizer in the synovium <EOS>
<SOS> subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect <EOS>
<SOS> the practicability of pdt was tested in an animal model of igg induced arthritis in rabbits <EOS>
<SOS> photosan 3 5 aminolevulinic acid and bpd ma were administered intraarticularly or intravenously <EOS>
<SOS> in this model concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells the lymphoid infiltrate and the skin was seen <EOS>
<SOS> after laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of photosan 3 not constant by bpd ma and without therapeutic effect by 5 aminolevulinic acid was observed <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage meniscus and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series <EOS>
<SOS> pdt thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its selectivity and efficacy <EOS>
<SOS> photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane <EOS>
<SOS> the purpose of the study was to identify associations between drug prescriptions and the risk of falls in community dwelling frail elderly people <EOS>
<SOS> enlargement of the prostate is an age related physiological process that is unique in human tissue <EOS>
<SOS> the prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men <EOS>
<SOS> despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia bph and prostate cancer remains poorly understood <EOS>
<SOS> this reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes <EOS>
<SOS> the present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate <EOS>
<SOS> there is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone <EOS>
<SOS> severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium <EOS>
<SOS> these premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability <EOS>
<SOS> during the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement mem brane like matrices <EOS>
<SOS> common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen responsive even in hormone independent disease <EOS>
<SOS> the frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells <EOS>
<SOS> the endocrine phenotype derives from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate amphicrine cell types <EOS>
<SOS> neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen insensitive cell population in prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> questionnaires were mailed anonymously to <NUM> german shock wave centers <EOS>
<SOS> twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy eswl center technical personnel laboratory etc <EOS>
<SOS> cooperation at eswl center with referring urologists laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work up <EOS>
<SOS> the return rate was <NUM> of <NUM> 76 <EOS>
<SOS> surprisingly at <NUM> of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done <EOS>
<SOS> the final conclusion was that eswl has largely replaced the causal metabolic work up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis <EOS>
<SOS> based on current insurance data patients with pseudophakia can be expected to suffer reduced stereoacuity <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective study was carried out to test this relationship <EOS>
<SOS> in <NUM> aulhorn and harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of motorists as well as for the corresponding examination methods <EOS>
<SOS> reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60 as well the established limits for twilight vision and glare sensitivity and their relevance to night time collisions has been re examined <EOS>
<SOS> hernias of the obturator foramen are rare <EOS>
<SOS> they are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health <EOS>
<SOS> often the correct diagnosis is stumbled upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings <EOS>
<SOS> surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an incarcerated hernia <EOS>
<SOS> herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before <EOS>
<SOS> for an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was neccesary to resect the superior pubic ramus <EOS>
<SOS> for plastic reconstruction a marlex mesh was used <EOS>
<SOS> acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure <EOS>
<SOS> the graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint thus avoiding the lateral incision <EOS>
<SOS> advantages of the single incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed <EOS>
<SOS> 40 patients with acl deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two incision technique with a follow up period of <NUM> years <EOS>
<SOS> preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups <EOS>
<SOS> at follow up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation <EOS>
<SOS> evaluation after <NUM> and <NUM> years according to the ikdc form revealed good to excellent results in <NUM> of all patients <EOS>
<SOS> the tegner score increased significantly however most patients did not regain their former activity level <EOS>
<SOS> acl reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at <NUM> months follow up <EOS>
<SOS> however we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after <NUM> and <NUM> years in both groups stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that an arthroscopic singleincision technique has no advantage compared to a mini open two incision technique for acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters <EOS>
<SOS> for determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis ms in germany the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available <EOS>
<SOS> if these rates are transferred to germany as a whole figures result of 67 00 to 138 00 ms patients in all <EOS>
<SOS> the differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients the epidemiological area and different population structures <EOS>
<SOS> to avoid these difficulties a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed ms was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in ms treatment <EOS>
<SOS> the disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> projecting the results in this way and their subsequent compilation taking double treatments into consideration showed a total of 122 00 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in germany <EOS>
<SOS> this figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of <NUM> per 100 00 inhabitants and is within the range found by poser et al <EOS>
<SOS> 19 <NUM> per 100 00 excluding the diagnostic category possible multiple sclerosis and <NUM> per 100 00 including it <EOS>
<SOS> the chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of beverages containing congeners of ethanol is described <EOS>
<SOS> glucuronides of the following alcohols were synthesized methanol d5 ethanol propanol isopropanol butanol isobutanol r<MOB>butanol s<MOB>butanol isopentanol and s<MOB>methylbutanol <EOS>
<SOS> the retention indices of acetyl pentafluorpropyl pfp and trimethylsilyl tms derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures <EOS>
<SOS> mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl moiety and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples <EOS>
<SOS> decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease <EOS>
<SOS> but worldwide tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent <EOS>
<SOS> in the industrialized countries immigration growth of low income groups and increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients mainly due to the hiv epidemic supply a reservoir for tuberculosis <EOS>
<SOS> five efficient str systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an a l f <EOS>
<SOS> the system humactbp2 and the combinations of the systems humvwa fga and humth01 d12s391 in duplex reactions were analysed <EOS>
<SOS> dna samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity 100 pg and the results were reproducible <EOS>
<SOS> no allele drop out was observed <EOS>
<SOS> using specific allelic ladders the inter and intra gel deviation was less than <NUM> bp <EOS>
<SOS> the allele frequencies the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power <NUM> for all five systems are shown <EOS>
<SOS> the combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of <MOB> <EOS>
<SOS> few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet <EOS>
<SOS> this comes at a time when electronic acquisition storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so called developed countries <EOS>
<SOS> new forms of integrated medical services will eventually evolve from these two trends <EOS>
<SOS> for information taken from many medical resources on the internet a relative lack of review processes requires special care and selection <EOS>
<SOS> the co operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes <EOS>
<SOS> this article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net <EOS>
<SOS> the accompanying internet website lists relevant resources <EOS>
<SOS> a calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in germany based on estimates of stone incidence types and recurrence rates actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis based on data from a district of the social health care system <EOS>
<SOS> there are 200 00 stone recurrences per year in germany <EOS>
<SOS> cost for treatment of these stones amount to 687 00 00 <EOS>
<SOS> stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some <NUM> <EOS>
<SOS> the annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by 275 300 00 <EOS>
<SOS> metabolic evaluation metaphylaxis amount to 70 100 00 per year resulting in an net saving of 205 200 00 <EOS>
<SOS> in 1997 there were <NUM> days off work per stone patient resulting in 5 800 00 days off work in germany per year <EOS>
<SOS> metaphylaxis in stone formers can lower health care cost significantly <EOS>
<SOS> although health care conditions may vary from country to country in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries <EOS>
<SOS> consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause <EOS>
<SOS> some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users the hers heart and estrogen progestin replacement study has recently been published <EOS>
<SOS> antiischemic effects of estrogens are mediated by improvement of menopausal associated endothelial dysfunction calcium antagonism and activation of endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin <EOS>
<SOS> improvement in functional state and reduction of stress induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy hrt have been demonstrated in several clinical trials <EOS>
<SOS> inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells <EOS>
<SOS> the adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the flowing blood <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying caliber affect leukocyte endothelium interaction <EOS>
<SOS> radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties 22 <EOS>
<SOS> the most suitable modalities are ct and mri preoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> in uncomplicated cases conventional imaging suffices for the postoperative needs <EOS>
<SOS> ct should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms <EOS>
<SOS> systemic immunotherapy notably with interleukin 2 il 2 and interferon ifn has yielded a response rate of <NUM> to <NUM> in metastic renal cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> however systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects and long lasting response is rare <EOS>
<SOS> tumor palliation and quality of life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy <EOS>
<SOS> experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local il 2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective <EOS>
<SOS> here we report long term experience with inhalation il 2 therapy in <NUM> patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma <EOS>
<SOS> high dose inhalation of il 2 was used with low dose systemic il 2 or ifn <EOS>
<SOS> maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild and the low incidence of who grade <NUM> toxicity 24 allowed social activities and peformance of social roles <EOS>
<SOS> comedication for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients <EOS>
<SOS> inhaled il 2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in <NUM> of patients for a median period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> median survival was <NUM> months compared with the expected <NUM> months and quality of life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status <EOS>
<SOS> local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy <EOS>
<SOS> it is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc <EOS>
<SOS> while hospitalized these patients are at great risk for developing an unexpected alcohol withdrawal syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> compared to common markers of alcohol abuse carbohydrate deficient transferrin cdt has been found to be more sensitive and specific <EOS>
<SOS> it is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal <EOS>
<SOS> we analyzed the serum concentrations of cdt liver enzymes and mean corpuscular volume in <NUM> male patients with hnscc <EOS>
<SOS> elevated cdt levels were found in more than 25 of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse <EOS>
<SOS> over one third of these patients developed an alcohol withdrawal syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> these findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated cdt serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and recognizing patients at risk for developing an alcohol withdrawal syndrome postoperatively <EOS>
<SOS> apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development <EOS>
<SOS> apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear dna and formation of apoptotic bodies <EOS>
<SOS> molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors <EOS>
<SOS> there are multiple inducers and inhibitors which interact with target cellspecific receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation cell cycle progression and programmed cell death <EOS>
<SOS> the elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well established strategy in cancer therapy <EOS>
<SOS> although improved cytotoxic chemo and radiotherapy regimens are available the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors <EOS>
<SOS> better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis including death genes death signals receptors and signal transduction pathways will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death <EOS>
<SOS> recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies <EOS>
<SOS> apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways <EOS>
<SOS> this information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among otherthings to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer <EOS>
<SOS> we report on a 63 year old female patient with muir torre syndrome mts <EOS>
<SOS> in the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon a kerato acanthoma and multiple sebaceous gland tumours including four sebaceous gland tumours including four sebaceous carcinomas appeared <EOS>
<SOS> this case is thought to be a heriditary form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous epithelioma <EOS>
<SOS> mts is a mostly autosomal dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas <EOS>
<SOS> as the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable <EOS>
<SOS> oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation <EOS>
<SOS> a narrower definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with mts <EOS>
<SOS> a total number of <NUM> of the <NUM> published cases of mts were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours <EOS>
<SOS> the data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of cohen et al <EOS>
<SOS> 1991 and <NUM> current cases were added <EOS>
<SOS> the rapid development of modern endovascular microsurgical and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for encephalic arteriovenous malformations avms <EOS>
<SOS> surgery has the longest history <EOS>
<SOS> single or staged intravascular procedures embolizations using fast acting glues sclerotic agents and thrombogenic coils serve to reduce the size of avm to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery <EOS>
<SOS> radiation gamma knife therapy most frequently used in small non operable avms is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small operable malformations <EOS>
<SOS> partial embolization to reduce the mass effect of space occupying avms to reverse diaschisis and to treat avm related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced <EOS>
<SOS> given the in part competing or even controversial options the selection of optimal treatment for avm patients is becoming increasingly difficult <EOS>
<SOS> current management is impeded by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course including the seriousness of such hemorrhage <EOS>
<SOS> a new all in one sensing device was developed for continuous transtracheal intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve rln during thyroid surgery <EOS>
<SOS> patients and methods the new system is based on a double balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and tracing electrodes <EOS>
<SOS> the recurrent laryngeal nerve is stimulated transtracheally and compound action potentials are recorded from the laryngeal muscles <EOS>
<SOS> fifty five patients were introduced into a phase one clinical trial <EOS>
<SOS> thirty five patients with primary thyroid operations <NUM> patients with reoperations <NUM> of whom had neck dissections <EOS>
<SOS> all patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and phoniatrically by an ent specialist before and after surgery <EOS>
<SOS> results compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded sensitively to tension and pressure to the nerve <EOS>
<SOS> there were no accidental permanent rln palsies <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion the new system offers five advantages 1 it is atraumatic 2 it is easy to use 3 it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon 4 it works outside the operation field and 5 it is highly sensitive even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors which only account for 1 of malignancies in humans represents quite a challange for the pathologist <EOS>
<SOS> apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections <EOS>
<SOS> in this context detailed clinical information including the patient is age and exact localization of the tumor as depicted by x ray or mri are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis <EOS>
<SOS> in addition multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help <EOS>
<SOS> for example 25 of osteogenic sarcomas osa are chondroplastic <EOS>
<SOS> others may contain areas similar to fibrosarcoma fsa or malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh <EOS>
<SOS> since 90 of osa occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas fsa and mfh usually manifest after the age of <NUM> years a biopsy solely composed of malignant chondromatous tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10 year old child should most likely be considered as part of an osa <EOS>
<SOS> in the differential diagnosis of the so called small round cell tumors which include ewing sarcoma malignant lymphoma and small cell osa immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin embedded material and a molecular biological genetic work up of frozen material are most helpful <EOS>
<SOS> in this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed <EOS>
<SOS> the care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and patientsi compliance <EOS>
<SOS> the aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment maybe cure options <EOS>
<SOS> if expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information it is reasonable to order them <EOS>
<SOS> if there is no benefit for the patient regarding survival or with respect to quality of life clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred <EOS>
<SOS> the effect on pain and heat sensation of monomere non ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double blind study <EOS>
<SOS> peripheral angiography was performed in <NUM> patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease <EOS>
<SOS> the two non ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually <EOS>
<SOS> the contrast media with an iodine concentration of <NUM> mg ml had an osmolality of <NUM> or <NUM> mosm kg <EOS>
<SOS> a contrast medium volume of <NUM> or <NUM> ml was injected in the abdominal aorta <EOS>
<SOS> the mean flow was <NUM> ml s <EOS>
<SOS> the two contrast medium injections were separated by an interval of <NUM> min <EOS>
<SOS> no analgesic premedication was given <EOS>
<SOS> the pain and heat intensity was semiquantatively measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from <NUM> no heat pain to <NUM> intractable heat pain <EOS>
<SOS> the median after the first injection was calculated as <NUM> for iomeprol and <NUM> for iopentol <EOS>
<SOS> the comparison of heat and pain sensations after the second injection showed a less distinct difference with a scale rating of <NUM> for iomeprol and of <NUM> for iopentol <EOS>
<SOS> the statistical variance was highly significant p 0 01 in favor of iomeprol <EOS>
<SOS> shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment <EOS>
<SOS> shampoos have primarily been products aimed at cleansing the hair and scalp <EOS>
<SOS> the diversity of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today is consumer go far beyond this general function <EOS>
<SOS> a cosmetic benefit is expected and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality dry greasy permed bleached dyed age baby shampoo care habit frequency of shampooing and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp dandruff seborrhea <EOS>
<SOS> selected ingredients of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use e g halogenated organic compounds formaldehyde musk fragrances and crude coal tar <EOS>
<SOS> our standard graduate training programs devote limited attention to <NUM> the subject of shampoos and much of the readily available information concerning shampoos is supplied by the industry <EOS>
<SOS> we should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level <EOS>
<SOS> in industrialized countries the rate of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged <EOS>
<SOS> the most frequently encountered structural heart disease in these patients is coronary artery disease <EOS>
<SOS> despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event <EOS>
<SOS> therefore risk stratification post mi before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory <EOS>
<SOS> dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach <EOS>
<SOS> globus pharyngis implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake <EOS>
<SOS> the diagnosis is based upon a careful history clinical examination endoscopy dynamic imaging videofluoroscopy cinematography videosonography and electrophysiologic procedures including pharyngoesophageal manometry electromyography and ph determinations <EOS>
<SOS> structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia <EOS>
<SOS> dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely <EOS>
<SOS> symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin <EOS>
<SOS> dyscoordinated swallowing nasal reflux dysphonia or general weakness may also occur <EOS>
<SOS> chronic aspiration with respiratory compromize is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia <EOS>
<SOS> relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus <EOS>
<SOS> dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia <EOS>
<SOS> a dyskinetic sphincter commonly represents an extrapharyngeal cause i e disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux <EOS>
<SOS> disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain heartburn regurgitation and vomiting as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs <EOS>
<SOS> esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia tumors peptic strictures inflammatory diseases drug induced ulcers rings and webs <EOS>
<SOS> motility disorders present with aperistaltic spontaneous contractions diffuse esophagospasm or a hypermotile esophagus <EOS>
<SOS> gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded especially in patients with a globus sensation <EOS>
<SOS> the multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment <EOS>
<SOS> different pest arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses <EOS>
<SOS> the movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause crusted papules severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their hosts by blood sucking or by sensitizing them to their saliva <EOS>
<SOS> furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions <EOS>
<SOS> farm animals cattle pig poultry and rabbit can transmit external parasites ticks ixodes ricinus argas reflexus fleas ceratophyllus gallinae spilopsyllus cuniculi and mites sarcoptes scabiei var <EOS>
<SOS> bovis sarcoptes scabiei var <EOS>
<SOS> suis dermanyssus gallinae cheyletiella parasitovorax and dermatophytes trichophyton sp and microsporum sp <EOS>
<SOS> people who have close contact to infested farm animals are more often exposed to epizoonotic infections <EOS>
<SOS> certain professions such as farmers and veterinarians are especially vulnerable <EOS>
<SOS> between <NUM> and <NUM> two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts <EOS>
<SOS> in the first study <MOB> <NUM> patients were tested with gold sodium thiosulfate nts 0 25 in vaseline v 0 5 v and with potassium dicyanoaurate kdc 0 002 aqueous solution <EOS>
<SOS> 44 patients 5 1 had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts <NUM> 4 6 to nts 0 5 v <NUM> 2 3 to nts 0 25 v and <NUM> 0 6 to kdc <EOS>
<SOS> a higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt 8 5 as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities 3 6 <EOS>
<SOS> immunologial complications frequently occur during the clinical course in patients with multiple injuries <EOS>
<SOS> the increased release of pro inflammatory mediators during the immunological response to trauma may lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and furthermore to multisystem organ failure mof which is associated with a mortality of up to 80 <EOS>
<SOS> the development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the traum <EOS>
<SOS> this manuscript reviews recent data in experimental trauma research and offers a more detailed evaluation of the immunological findings in trauma patients <EOS>
<SOS> in particular the role of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines in the development or sirs mof and rof is discussed <EOS>
<SOS> despite the enormous progress in clinical immunology and the available data on trauma induced immune dysfunction a large number of questions still remain to be answered before the immunological alterations following severe trauma can be beneficially influenced by immunomodulatory therapeutic efforts <EOS>
<SOS> a report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node so called mesothelioma of the av node or endodermal inclusions of the heart <EOS>
<SOS> in one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system av block and of the sudden and unexpected death <EOS>
<SOS> a case of delayed death after a low voltage accident is presented <EOS>
<SOS> at first an obvious source of electricity was not found <EOS>
<SOS> however electric marks were found on the fingers <EOS>
<SOS> the identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the metallisation of the electric marks <EOS>
<SOS> the location of the probable conductors in a boiler under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a bathtub indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period <EOS>
<SOS> in such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation <EOS>
<SOS> a 53 year old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus <EOS>
<SOS> after laser therapy left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out <EOS>
<SOS> complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty <EOS>
<SOS> based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma <EOS>
<SOS> there was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous mucous membrane or ocular lesion <EOS>
<SOS> examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor <EOS>
<SOS> we conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract a rare neoplasm of which only <NUM> cases have been confirmed <EOS>
<SOS> the patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow up period of <NUM> months <EOS>
<SOS> background to find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years <EOS>
<SOS> results <NUM> out of <NUM> patients showed spontaneous puberty <EOS>
<SOS> there exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other <EOS>
<SOS> basal as well as stimulated gonadotropin levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in turner syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> conclusion in contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with turner syndrome <EOS>
<SOS> therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty <EOS>
<SOS> from january <NUM> until april 1995 <NUM> patients with trans and suprasphincteric anal fistulae transsphincteric n 21 suprasphincteric n 4 transsphincteric in crohn is disease n 6 underwent a fistulectomy followed by closure of the internal opening by suture and anocutaneous flap <EOS>
<SOS> all patients had undergone previous operations some several times <EOS>
<SOS> the recurrence rate of <NUM> appeared to be low after a short follow up <EOS>
<SOS> continence was only negligibly impaired although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced <EOS>
<SOS> in five patients a shortened prewarning period was noticed <EOS>
<SOS> also in crohn is fistulae the results were equivalent when the surgical treatment was performed in a non inflammatory period <EOS>
<SOS> staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities <EOS>
<SOS> as radiology should never try to replace histology the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and differention of tumour from edema and posttherapeutic changes <EOS>
<SOS> only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact <EOS>
<SOS> post traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes <EOS>
<SOS> this prospectively designed study evaluates the long term results of a modified eden hybinette procedure in young male athletes <EOS>
<SOS> the criteria were capacity in sports functional limit and persistent pain <EOS>
<SOS> genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion <EOS>
<SOS> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium <EOS>
<SOS> it is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation <EOS>
<SOS> the most important complication of hcm sudden cardiac death is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3 5 in childhood <EOS>
<SOS> while most patients remain asymptomatic for years there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years <EOS>
<SOS> a prospective study was performed on <NUM> patients with osteochondritis dissecans od of the knee and ankle to compare plane radiography mri and arthroscopy before therapeutic procedures <EOS>
<SOS> special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy <EOS>
<SOS> od was localized in <NUM> cases on the femoral condyle and in <NUM> cases on the talus <EOS>
<SOS> radiological methods were performed simultaneously and shortly before definite arthroscopical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> using conventional radiography od of the condyles was staged according to the classification of rodegerdts and gleissner and od of the talus suggested by berndt and harty <EOS>
<SOS> mri staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the od <EOS>
<SOS> arthroscopical staging based on the classification of guhl <EOS>
<SOS> there was an excellent correlation between the stages in mri and arthroscopy showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92 <EOS>
<SOS> in contrast fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be stably fixed in cases of bony separation <EOS>
<SOS> mri is indicated before performance of staging related therapy of od to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable od for surgical therapy <EOS>
<SOS> a case of rupture of the right hemidiaphragm resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented <EOS>
<SOS> after a primary chest x ray study had been interpreted as showing right sided hemothorax the thoracic drainage tube was accidentally placed into the liver <EOS>
<SOS> ct revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation <EOS>
<SOS> the liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach <EOS>
<SOS> problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed <EOS>
