# **TAXOEMBED** #


## Train ##
```
python train_transMat.py <training_data> <embeddings> <domains_file> <input_domain> <expand>
```

* <training_data> is a two-column text file,  where column 1 has terms, and column 2 has hypernyms.
* <embeddings> is a binary or text file with embeddings in word2vec format (first line of the file should contain the following info: <num_vecs><space><numb_dimensions>.
* <domains_file> tab-separated file, column 1 has synsets, column 2 has their associated domain (e.g. bn:david_bowie<tab>Music)
- <input_domain> is a knowledge domain, e.g. 'music' or 'media'. It can have value ' ' for skipping the domain-wise term filtering.
* <expand> is an optional argument which can have either 'expanded' or ' ' value. Use "expand" if your data is at synset level, and your embeddings are at sense level. For example, a training instance may contain the synset *performance.n.01* and you may have embeddings like *performance_wn:performance* and *performance_wn:public_presentation*.

The above saves a *filtered* vectors file to speed up testing, called ```vectors_domain.txt```, and the transformation matrix in text format ```transformation_matrix+_domain+.txt```, or ```transformation_matrix_general.txt``` if <input_domain>='none'.

## Predict ##

Apply the learned transformation matrix to your test data with:

```
python batch_predict.py <data> <matrix_file> <embeddings> <topn> <expanded>
```

- <data> text file, with one concept per line.
- <matrix_file> obtained in step 1.
- <embeddings> the same ones used in step 1, or the filtered ones.
- <topn> Top *n* candidate hypernyms to be retrieved for each input term.
- <expanded> same flag as in step 1.

You can also play interactively in the python console, with:

```
python interactive_predict.py <matrix_file> <embeddings> <topn> <expanded>
```

The program will prompt you for a concept name, until you type 'leave'.

## Evaluate ##

Evaluate the performance of your hypernym discovery algorithm with:

```
python evaluate.py <gold_file> <predictions_file> 
```

- <gold_file> Text file where column 1 is the term, and from column 2 are valid hypernyms.
- <predictions_file> Text file where column 1 is the term, and columns 2 onwards are either <candidate><space><score> pairs, or simplpy the candidates.

It will save a  <predictions_file>+__results.txt file with classic IR metrics computed on your data, such as MRR, MAP, P@K and R-P. The code for computing these metrics comes from [here](https://gist.github.com/bwhite/3726239).
